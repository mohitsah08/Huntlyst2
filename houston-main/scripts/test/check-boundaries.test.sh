# Builds a throwaway open/closed package tree, copies the real script in (it
# computes its root relative to its own location, so it checks the fixture), and
# asserts:
#   * a clean tree passes (exit 0);
#   * every leak vector the script is supposed to catch FAILS (exit 1) with the
#     expected message — the three holes from HOU-584 plus the pre-existing ones:
#       - deep-relative import into packages/host-cloud (Hole 1)
#       - require() of a cloud lib                      (Hole 2)
#       - an UNDECLARED bare import (novel cloud dep)    (Hole 3, allowlist half)
#       - a cloud lib / closed package DECLARED in an open package.json (Hole 3, manifest)
#       - a bare @houston/host-cloud import              (the original check)
#       - a cloud lib imported by a non-allowlisted file
#       - a reappearing packages/host-cloud dir (Rule B — retired and deleted)
#       - a cloud import in a BRAND-NEW package (dynamic enumeration — a fixed
#         open-package list would let cloud code reappear under a new name)
#   * a commented-out cloud import does NOT false-fail (comment stripping);
#   * leftover gitignored build artifacts under packages/host-cloud do NOT
#     false-fail Rule B (pnpm node_modules survives a branch switch);
#   * a repo-scoped alias import (@houston/app/...) does NOT false-fail rule (d);
#   * the runtime's GcsStore adapter + dep are the one allowed exception.
