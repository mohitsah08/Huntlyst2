  "Every `path` is the FULL host path - nothing is prepended to it. A route carries its JSON body EITHER as `body` (one parameter sent whole) OR as `bodyFields` (body key -> parameter); a caller that reads only `body` sends an empty body for every `bodyFields` route. Each path parameter says how its value is escaped: `segment` is one URL segment, `path` keeps the `/` separators of a relative path. Every route returns the host response verbatim; `rawResponse: true` flags the ones whose adapter function additionally post-processes it (unwrapping `items`, 404 fallbacks, `.then` transforms), which a caller driving the route directly does not get. A parameter may also carry `description` (the author's `@param` line), `source` (the operation that LISTS the values it accepts), `resolver` (the app checks the value against that live list before it acts: pass the id, or the exact name the user said, and anything else comes back refused with the values that exist) and `unresolved` (why no live list backs this one). An identifier is never to be guessed: use the closed set in its `schema`, pass a name the app resolves, or call its `source` first.";
