/**
 * WHAT a parameter's value is, in one table.
 *
 * An identifier is never guessable. The catalog already says a parameter is a
 * string; what it could not say is that the string must be an agent that exists,
 * which operation would have listed it, and whether the host can check it
 * before the call leaves - so a model asked to rename an agent invented a slug
 * and the call 404'd with nothing to correct from. Each rule below answers all
 * three: the operation that enumerates the values (`discovery`), and either the
 * live `EntityDirectory` list the host resolves the value against
 * (`collection`) or the reason no live list backs it (`unlisted`).
 *
 * DECLARATIVE on purpose. The mapping is derived from the route the generator
 * already extracted - the literal segment a placeholder follows (`/agents/{x}`
 * -> an agent, `/routines/{x}` -> a routine) - so a new operation on an existing
 * collection is identified the day it is annotated, with nothing added here.
 * Only genuinely new collections, and the handful of body/query fields whose
 * route cannot say what they are, need a line.
