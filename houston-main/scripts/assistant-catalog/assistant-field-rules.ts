 * FIELDS INSIDE A BODY OBJECT, matched as `<parameter>.<field>` (the nested walk

 * Qualified on purpose: `provider` at the top level of the integration
 * operations is the app-integration provider, a different thing entirely from
 * the AI provider these pin. A bare rule would claim both.
 *
 * Kept beside the path rules rather than among them because they answer a
 * different question - the path says nothing about a body field, so the only
 * evidence here is the name and the parameter carrying it.
