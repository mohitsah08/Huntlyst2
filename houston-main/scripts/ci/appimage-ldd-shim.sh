# linuxdeploy runs `ldd` on every ELF in the AppDir to discover the shared
# libraries it must bundle. Two of our externalBins can't be traced by `ldd`
# and make it exit non-zero, which aborts the whole bundle with:
#     terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
#       what():  Failed to run ldd: exited with code 1
#   * houston-engine — self-contained Bun-compiled sidecar; `ldd` ends up
#     executing it, it ignores LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS and exits non-zero.
#   * claude         — self-contained Claude Code binary, same story.
#
# Both bundle their own runtime (or are static) and only need the ordinary
# system libc, so they have NO libraries for linuxdeploy to deploy. Report each
# as "not a dynamic executable" with a success exit so linuxdeploy deploys
# nothing for them and moves on, and defer to the real ldd for every other file
# (so genuine library resolution is unaffected). Any future self-contained
# externalBin must be added to the match below.
