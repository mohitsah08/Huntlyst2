 *
 * It runs on every `pnpm check` (`check:sdk-parity`) and FAILS the process on
 * any violation the exceptions file does not excuse. Both servers are always
 * judged: the host declares its own route registry, and the gateway's is
 * vendored into scripts/sdk-parity/gateway-routes.generated.json, so a run with
 * no cloud checkout is a full run rather than a blind spot. Every remaining
 * violation is written down, with the reason it stands, in
 * scripts/sdk-parity-exceptions.json.
 *
 * Run with tsx, not `node --experimental-strip-types`: the host's modules
 * import each other extensionlessly, which Node's ESM resolver refuses.
