# Build the ggml-org/whisper.cpp `whisper-cli` binary for a target platform and
# stage it where `app/src-tauri/build.rs` (`stage_whisper_sidecar`) picks it up
# for Tauri's `externalBin` bundling as `binaries/whisper-cli-<triple>`.
#
# whisper-cli is the local-dictation sidecar the desktop spawns to transcribe
# microphone audio for voice typing in the chat box (no cloud round-trip).
# whisper.cpp is MIT.
#
# The pinned source tarball is SHA256-verified before building. The binary is
# built fully static (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`) so it carries no whisper/ggml
# shared-library dependency, and on macOS Metal is embedded into the binary
# (`-DGGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=ON`) so there is no sibling `.metallib` to ship.
# On Windows the MSVC CRT is statically linked too (no VC++ redistributable
# needed on user machines). On macOS the result is verified dylib-free with
# `otool -L`; on Windows it is verified free of VC++ runtime DLL imports.
#
# Output:
#   target/whisper/whisper-cli-<rust-triple>          (macOS / Linux)
#   target/whisper/whisper-cli-<rust-triple>.exe      (Windows)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-whisper.sh                    # current host triple
#   scripts/build-whisper.sh <rust-triple>      # an explicit target (CI, per-arch)

#
# On macOS a non-host arch is cross-built via CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES (this is
# how the release workflow produces both slices for the universal lipo). On
# Linux/Windows the requested arch must match the host arch (each release runner
# builds its own arch natively) — a mismatch is rejected.

# ARM x64 emulator on ARM64 runners, so `uname -m` reports "x86_64" even when the
# CPU is ARM64 — which falsely tripped the native-arch guard on the
# `windows-11-arm` runner (every other tool here — rustc, bun — detects aarch64
# correctly). Resolve the REAL CPU arch from signals that survive the emulation,
# in order of authority:
#   1. RUNNER_ARCH — set by GitHub Actions to the runner's true arch (ARM64/X64),
#      guaranteed present + correct in CI (where this guard misfired).
#   2. PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 — set by Windows only inside an emulated/WOW
#      process, where it holds the native host arch (ARM64 for x64-on-ARM).
#   3. PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE — the process-visible arch (AMD64 on a native x64
#      host, or under emulation when #2 is absent).
# Fall through to `uname -m` for non-Windows hosts and local shells that set none.
