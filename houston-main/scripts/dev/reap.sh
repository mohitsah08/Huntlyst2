# Reap the Houston dev stack, wherever it was started. This machine runs ONE
# dev stack — `pnpm dev` calls this before booting (last starter wins, so a
# stack left running in another worktree never blocks you), and `pnpm dev:down`
# is this script directly.
#
# Kill order: the recorded mprocs owner first (graceful), then a signature
# sweep for orphans that escaped their pane (a compiled `go run` child survives
# its wrapper — learned the hard way), then the pg container, then the holders
# of OUR ports if their command is recognizably ours. Anything foreign on a
# port is deliberately left alone — the doctor names it and fails.
