# `pnpm dev:staging` — run the desktop app (Tauri) as a CLIENT of a REMOTE
# Houston Cloud STAGING environment.
#
# This is NOT `pnpm dev`. `pnpm dev` boots the entire local stack (Postgres,
# Go gateway, control-plane, local host, web) and the desktop talks to
# localhost. Here NOTHING runs locally except the desktop shell: the gateway,
# the per-agent engines, sign-in and every backend live in the staging cloud.
# It is the production "Houston Cloud desktop" shape (hosted-oauth: real
# sign-in, multiplayer in the window) — just pointed at the staging gateway.
#
# Env model — a SINGLE self-contained, gitignored file (NOT the two-file dev
# contract): .env.staging holds the real staging URLs + credentials. We
# deliberately do NOT source .env.development: it is all-localhost (its
# VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4318 would pin the desktop to a local
# host that isn't running), so it would fight every staging value.
#
# Required keys (the script fails fast, by name, if any is missing):
#   VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL   the staging gateway URL (the hosted engine)
#   FIREBASE_API_KEY         staging GCIP Web API key (Google sign-in)
#   GOOGLE_DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET   desktop OAuth
# Optional: FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID / FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN (if staging uses its own
# GCIP project), VITE_AGENTSTORE_GATEWAY_URL, MICROSOFT_DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID.
