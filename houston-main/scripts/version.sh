# Portability rules this script obeys (do NOT reintroduce the violations a
# release cut from a non-macOS host will hit):
#   * NO `jq` to rewrite JSON. The Windows jq build emits CRLF and
#     reserializes the whole document, turning a one-line version bump into
#     a full-file EOL-churn diff (and breaking the repo's LF-only rule).
#   * NO `sed -i ''` (BSD syntax). GNU sed on Linux + Windows git-bash reads
#     the empty '' as the script and aborts the whole run under `set -e`.
#   * `perl -i -pe` is the one editor present and identical on all three:
#     it rewrites a single matched line and never touches line endings, so
#     LF-in stays LF-out everywhere.

# name (never the literal "version"), so the first `"version":` line is always
# the package's own. The $d guard stops after the first hit per file so a
# stray nested "version" downstream can never be clobbered.

# build fails on the toml/lock mismatch (prior releases regenerated it by
# hand — now it's part of the bump). `cargo update --workspace` refreshes only
# the workspace members' entries.
