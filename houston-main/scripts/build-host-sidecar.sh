# ============================================================================
# Bun-compile the Houston single sidecar into a self-contained binary and stage
# it where `build.rs` picks it up for Tauri's `externalBin` bundling.
#
# ONE binary, TWO roles: the compiled `sidecar-entry.ts` runs as the local HOST
# by default, or as a pi RUNTIME when HOUSTON_SIDECAR_ROLE=runtime. The host
# spawns ITSELF (same binary) in runtime mode, so the packaged .app needs no
# `bun` and no repo source to launch a runtime — fixing the packaging gap where
# a source-run default (`node --import tsx <repo>/packages/runtime/src/main.ts`)
# could never resolve inside the .app.
#
# Every desktop build ships THIS binary as its one and only sidecar — the Tauri
# shell spawns it (see app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs `spawn_host_sidecar` +
# engine_supervisor::parse_banner for HOUSTON_HOST_LISTENING). Release builds
# hard-fail in build.rs if it hasn't been compiled first.
#
# Output:
#   target/host-sidecar/houston-host-<rust-triple>            (macOS / Linux)
#   target/host-sidecar/houston-host-<rust-triple>.exe        (Windows)
#
# The <rust-triple> matches Tauri's `externalBin` suffix convention so the
# build.rs stager can rename it to `binaries/houston-engine-<triple>` — the
# same name the Rust engine uses, which keeps tauri.conf.json untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh                         # current host, compile only
#   scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh --verify                # current host, then boot + curl
#   scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh <rust-triple>           # an explicit target (CI)
#   scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh <rust-triple> --verify  # explicit target, then boot + curl
#
# An explicit <rust-triple> (e.g. x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, aarch64-apple-darwin,
# x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) lets CI build each target with the SAME script the local
# build uses — no second bun-compile invocation to drift. Bun links its own libc,
# so same-OS cross-arch works (this is how the macOS universal build compiles BOTH
# arches on one runner); each CI runner still builds its own OS. --verify only
# makes sense for a host-native target (it boots the binary).

# The Bun-compiled sidecar can't resolve the SDK's native `claude` binary at
# runtime (it lives outside Bun's $bunfs virtual FS — see
# packages/runtime/src/backends/claude/binary-path.ts). So we ship the platform
# `claude` binary as a SIBLING: build.rs stages it as the Tauri externalBin
# `binaries/claude-<triple>` (alongside `binaries/houston-engine-<triple>`), so
# both land in the same bundle dir (Contents/MacOS on macOS) and the macOS
# signing/notarization sweep signs it like any other bundled binary.
# resolveClaudeExecutable() then points the SDK at `<dir of sidecar>/claude`.
#
# The binary comes from the SDK's per-platform optional package in the pnpm
# store: @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<os>-<arch> (glibc for linux; the
# desktop AppImage/deb are glibc). pnpm installs only the HOST-matching platform
# package, so a cross-target build (e.g. the macOS universal build compiling
# x86_64 on an arm64 runner) needs the non-native package force-installed first
# (`pnpm add -w @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<os>-<arch>@<ver> --force`), the
# same requirement the SDK README documents for `bun build --compile`.
