Houston is one TypeScript engine (the pi runtime behind the host), serving the
desktop app, the browser app and the managed cloud from the same code.

## What Houston is

**For everyone** — a free desktop app with AI agents that do real work. Bookkeeping, outreach, research, scheduling. Create or import agents and start working. No terminal. No prompt engineering.

**For founders** — the platform where you build AI-native products for your customers. Define your agents, Houston handles the workspace, the chat, the board, the integrations. You bring the domain expertise. [Read more](https://gethouston.ai/startups/).

> **Read the vision:** [Ship the impossible](https://gethouston.ai/vision/)

---

## Quick start

### Run the Houston app

**Prerequisites:** [Node 22+](https://nodejs.org), [pnpm 10](https://pnpm.io) (`corepack enable`), the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) (Tauri builds the desktop shell), [Go](https://go.dev) and Docker Desktop (the local cloud stack: gateway, control-plane, Postgres), and the sibling [`gethouston/cloud`](https://github.com/gethouston/cloud) checkout cloned next to this repo. Bun is only needed when compiling the host sidecar binary (`scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh`). Don't audit this list by hand — `pnpm dev` runs a doctor that checks every prerequisite and prints the exact fix for anything missing.

**1. Clone and install.** pnpm owns the whole JS/TS workspace: app, web, UI packages, host, runtime, and supporting packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethouston/houston.git
git clone https://github.com/gethouston/cloud.git      # sibling checkout
cd houston

pnpm install
```

**2. Configure once.** Non-secret dev config is committed in `.env.development` — you never touch it. Secrets go in `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local     # then set FIREBASE_API_KEY (ask a teammate)
```

**3. Run.** One command, the whole product:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The doctor validates your setup (and prints the feature matrix for this run), then mprocs starts every pane: Postgres, the Go gateway (`:9080`), the control-plane (engines spawn as local processes — no Kubernetes), the local host (`:4318`), the **desktop app** (local profile: terminal, files, local models, no sign-in), and the **web app** (`http://localhost:1430`, cloud profile: real Google sign-in, multiplayer Teams/Spaces).

To test multiplayer, sign into the web app as user A, then open an incognito window and sign in as user B — share an agent into a team, invite, accept, chat. On first launch, connect an AI provider (or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to seed every dev engine). Local-profile workspaces live in `~/.houston/workspaces`; dev cloud engines under `~/.dev-houston-cloud`.

#### Configure providers

Connect model providers from the AI Models screen inside the app. Anthropic and OpenAI use in-app OAuth flows. API-key providers such as OpenRouter, Google Gemini, and Amazon Bedrock accept keys in the same UI. Model providers are not configured through environment variables.

#### Connected apps (integrations)

Connected apps (Gmail, Slack, and about 1000 more) run in platform mode through [Composio](https://composio.dev). The packaged desktop app forwards these calls through Houston's cloud with your signed-in session, so it holds no provider key. To run integrations fully locally instead, create your own free Composio project and launch the app (or the host, in the dev loop) with `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` set in the environment: the host then talks to Composio directly and no integration call touches Houston's cloud. Leave both unset to run with integrations off. See `.env.example` for the dev wiring.

> Committed `.env.development` + secrets-only `.env.local` is the whole env story — the doctor refuses to boot if `.env.local` re-defines a committed key, so no two teammates can run different stacks. Each pane also writes `~/.dev-houston/logs/dev-<pane>.log`, so a bug stays readable after the stack is gone.

### Test like production (Kubernetes)

`pnpm dev` already runs the full product, including multiplayer, with engines as local processes. When you need to verify the **Kubernetes-shaped** parts before a release — per-agent pods and PVCs, namespaces, NetworkPolicy, PV-rebind agent moves — run the [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) loop from the sibling cloud repo:

```bash
make -C ../cloud kind-up      # cluster + gateway + engine pods; see cloud/k8s/kind/README.md
```

Billing is off unless `GW_STRIPE_*` test keys are set (teams run as free multiplayer orgs); see `cloud/docs/deploy-C8.md` §Stage 2.

### Build your first agent

Create two files:

**houston.json**
```json
{
  "id": "bookkeeper",
  "name": "Bookkeeper",
  "description": "Categorize expenses and reconcile accounts.",
  "icon": "Calculator",
  "category": "business"
}
```

**CLAUDE.md**
```markdown
# Bookkeeper

You categorize transactions, reconcile accounts, and flag anomalies.
Ask which period the user wants before starting.
```

Push to GitHub. In Houston, click **New Agent > GitHub**, paste your repo URL. Done.

The [Learn guide](https://gethouston.ai/learn/) covers the full details in five short chapters.

### Share a workspace template

Bundle multiple agents into one repo:

```
my-workspace/
├── workspace.json
└── agents/
    ├── bookkeeper/
    │   ├── houston.json
    │   └── CLAUDE.md
    └── tax-reviewer/
        ├── houston.json
        └── CLAUDE.md
```

**workspace.json**
```json
{
  "name": "Tax Practice",
  "description": "A complete workspace for tax professionals.",
  "agents": ["bookkeeper", "tax-reviewer"]
}
```

In Houston, click **New Workspace > Import from GitHub**, paste the repo URL. Houston creates the workspace with all agents ready to use.

## How the app works

Houston organizes work into **Workspaces** and **Agents**:

- **Workspace** — a group of agents (like a team or project).
- **Agent** — an AI agent instance. Chat, kanban board, skills, files, integrations.
- **Agent Definition** — a `houston.json` that defines what an agent looks like and does.

```
Workspace ("Tax Practice")
  ├── Agent ("Bookkeeper")         ← board, files, instructions
  ├── Agent ("Document Reviewer")  ← board, files, integrations
  └── Agent ("Client Comms")       ← board, files, integrations
```

Each kanban card is a Claude conversation. Click a card to see the full chat. Connect Slack and the same conversation becomes a thread.

---

## Agent definitions

Two tiers:

| Tier | What you write | What you get |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **JSON-only** | `houston.json` + `CLAUDE.md` | A new agent in a team, listed in the sidebar. Its missions land on the team's Mission Control board; its routines, files and configuration live in that team's sections. |
| **Workspace template** | `workspace.json` + agents folder | Multiple agents, one import. |

An agent has no screen of its own. Everything about it is a slice of its **team**: work on the team's Mission Control board, schedules under Routines, its documents under Files, and everything configurable (job description, memory, skills, who may use it, which apps and models it may reach) on one per-agent settings page reached from Team Settings.

---

## Run With Docker

Use `selfhost/` to run Houston behind HTTPS on a VPS. Docker builds one
Node-based host image that spawns the pi runtime in-container, plus Caddy for TLS.
The web UI is a static build served by Caddy from `selfhost/web`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethouston/houston
cd houston
pnpm install
VITE_NEW_ENGINE=1 pnpm --filter houston-web build
mkdir -p selfhost/web && cp -R packages/web/dist/. selfhost/web/
cd selfhost
cp .env.example .env          # set HOUSTON_DOMAIN and HOUSTON_HOST_TOKEN
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

See the [full self-host guide](selfhost/README.md), or deploy to
[Railway](selfhost/deploy-railway.md) or a
[Hostinger VPS](selfhost/deploy-hostinger.md). The lower-level runtime image
lives at `packages/runtime/Dockerfile`; it is not the full app.

## Monorepo layout

Organized around the desktop app, the browser app, the converged TypeScript
engine, and the supporting product surfaces.

```

See `CLAUDE.md` for the repo map and conventions.

## Build on Houston Host (custom frontends)

The host is frontend-agnostic. You don't have to ship inside the Houston App,
any web or native runtime can drive it over protocol v3 HTTP + SSE. The wire
types and their zod schemas are [`packages/protocol`](packages/protocol/); the
reference client that speaks them is
[`@houston/engine-adapter`](packages/engine-adapter/), and the behavior layer
every Houston surface binds on top of it is
[`@houston/sdk`](packages/sdk/).

The canonical non-Tauri consumer is `packages/web`, the full desktop UI in a
browser tab over the host's protocol v3.
