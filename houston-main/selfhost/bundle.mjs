// Node module RESOLUTION (getPackageScopeConfig/internalModuleStat walks over
// the Kata guest filesystem, profiled 2026-08-27) because every npm import
// stayed external. The same code as one self-contained file evaluates in
// ~0.3s.
//  - @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk: lazily imported, and it spawns the
//    `claude` subprocess from its own package directory — bundling would
//    break that file layout. Cloud never reaches it (Anthropic is OFF there);
//    selfhost resolves it from node_modules as before.
//  - @silvia-odwyer/photon-node: pi's image-resize wasm host locates
//    photon_rs_bg.wasm with __dirname — bundled, that resolves nowhere and
//    every image an agent reads silently degrades to "[Image omitted…]".
//    Lazily imported; resolves from the image's node_modules.
//  - @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent: its provider registry lazy-loads
//    per-provider auth/stream chunks with a RUNTIME-COMPUTED relative
//    import specifier esbuild cannot rewrite. Inlined, that import resolves
//    beside the bundle ("/app/dist/runtime/openai-codex.js") and every pi
//    OAuth derivation for a chunked provider dies at turn time. External,
//    pi resolves its own chunks from its package directory as designed.
//  - @earendil-works/gondolin: finds its guest assets and QEMU helpers from
//    its own package directory (import.meta.dirname). Lazily imported, and
//    only by a pool worker in `vm` code-execution mode.
//  - *.node native addons load via the filesystem by design.
