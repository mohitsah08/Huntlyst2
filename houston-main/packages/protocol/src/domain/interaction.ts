/**
 * The RUNTIME side of a pending interaction: the tolerant structural guards

 * remains the single import for both.
 *
 * Type-only import on purpose: it is erased, which keeps this module free of
 * runtime relative imports. The app's node:test runner loads it directly by
 * subpath, and Node's ESM resolver cannot follow an extensionless `./x`.

 *    cannot read says nothing about what should be stored — leaves it alone,

 *    keeps the clean-finish offers (see {@link retainSuggestionSteps}).

 * load-bearing: a `{status:"done"}` patch that ALSO carried a junk interaction
 * would otherwise skip the strip and leave a question stepper on a Done card.
