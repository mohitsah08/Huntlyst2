// A pending interaction: the ordered sequence of steps a mission ends a turn
// on. Recorded when the model calls ask_user / request_connection, carried on
// the terminal `done` wire frame, and persisted on the Activity so the card can
// render it. The UI renders the blocking steps as ONE composer-replacing card
// that walks the user through them one at a time, with a "1 of X" progress
// indicator.
//
// It does NOT decide the board status: every settled turn that is not a real
// failure lands `needs_you` — the engine never writes `done`, because closing a
// mission is the user's own move. The interaction is what that card SHOWS.
//
// A turn's steps are the question steps (from one ask_user call, 1 to 3
// questions) FOLLOWED BY at most one signin step (the user must sign in to
// Houston first) FOLLOWED BY the connect steps (one per request_connection
// call, deduped by toolkit). Any single kind alone still yields a valid
// sequence.
//
// `suggest_reusable` and `suggest_actions` are the non-blocking kinds: optional
// clean-finish offers, respectively for saving reusable work and for concrete
// follow-up actions. They arrive on the same `done` frame, render above the
// composer rather than replacing it, and outlive the user's later move to done.
