/**
 * The ONE source of truth for context-window sizing, shared by the frontend
 * usage indicator (the "context bar") and the runtime's autocompact + provider-
 * switch decisions. Both used to size the window independently — the bar divided
 * by Houston's per-model default (snapping up to a ceiling once observed usage
 * proved a larger window), while the runtime divided by pi-ai's RAW registry
 * window — so they disagreed: the runtime never compacted a 200k-real Claude
 * chat pi reports as 1M, and needlessly compacted a Gemini chat pi under-reports.
 *
 * This module lives in `@houston/protocol` (an OPEN, dependency-free leaf that
 * already owns the catalog wire shapes) so the runtime (`@houston/runtime`) and
 * the app catalog (`app/src/lib/providers.ts`) both import the SAME numbers and
 * the SAME snap-up rule. Option A of the context-bar fix: one table, no drift,
 * no cross-package parity test needed (the runtime tests pin these values).
 *
 * Keys are pi-ai PROVIDER ids (the runtime speaks these verbatim; the app looks
 * up by the pre-rename `piProvider.id`, so `openai-codex` — not the app's
 * post-rename `openai` — is the key here).
 *
 * Only models whose real window differs from pi-ai's raw registry value appear.
 * Notably ABSENT: the `google` provider's Gemini models — pi-ai already reports
 * their true 1,048,576 window, so no override is needed (the stale 128,000 some
 * research cited is `github-copilot`'s Gemini copy, a legitimately smaller cap
 * we do not touch).

/**
 * Per-model window overrides, keyed by pi-ai provider id then model id. Present
 * ONLY where Houston's real window differs from pi-ai's raw registry value:
 *
 * - `anthropic` — pi reports 1,000,000 for the flagships, but standard (Pro,
 *   non-credit) plans get 200k; the 1M window is credit/plan-gated, so the
 *   estimate starts at 200k and snaps to 1M once observed usage proves it.
 *   `claude-opus-5` follows the rest of the Opus line (same subscription
 *   gating). `claude-fable-5`, `claude-fable-5-1` and `claude-sonnet-5` are
 *   intentionally omitted (no evidence any is plan-gated — pi's flat 1M
 *   stands for all three).
 * - `openai-codex` — Codex's `/status` reports a 95%-EFFECTIVE window (the
 *   number the user sees), so each row's default is 95% of pi's window for it:
 *   every served row (the gpt-6 line, the gpt-5.6 line and gpt-5.5) sits at
 *   272,000 × 0.95 = 258,400, and every row carries the 1M × 95% ceiling of
 *   Codex's opt-in 1M variant. pi reports one window and one price tier for
 *   the whole line, so no row is singled out; the ceiling only ever applies
 *   once observed usage proves it (`effectiveModelWindow`), so a row without
 *   the variant loses nothing, while a served row WITHOUT the ceiling pins the
 *   bar at 100% and compacts at 258k on a chat the provider would carry on.
 *
 * Every row here names a model the domain catalog still lists
 * (`@houston/domain` `VALID_MODELS`); a model the catalog drops is a row no
 * turn can reach, and a stale ceiling is worse than none.
