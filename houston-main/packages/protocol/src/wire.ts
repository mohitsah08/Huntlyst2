/**
 * Live conversation events (SSE), one stream per conversation, strictly
 * id-scoped. Each SSE frame is `data: <WireFrame JSON>` — a WireEvent plus the
 * stream's `seq` cursor (see WireFrame below for the resume semantics).
 *
 * - `sync`  — once on connect (and after an unserviceable resume cursor): is a
 *   turn running + assistant text so far + `seq`, the stream's current
 *   watermark (0 when nothing was ever published in this process), plus
 *   `turnId` — the id of the RUNNING turn (absent when idle), so the client
 *   can tell whether live frames that follow belong to a turn it started or
 *   to another writer's (a teammate, a second tab, a routine). `resync:
 *   true` is set only when the client supplied a resume cursor that could not
 *   be served — the client must treat the stream as fresh (refetch history,
 *   rebuild from this snapshot) instead of splicing.
 * - `user`  — a user message was added (by any client); `nonce` echoes the sender's.
 * - `text` / `thinking` — assistant output deltas.
 * - `tool_start` / `tool_end` — tool activity within the turn.
 * - `usage` — normalized token usage for the turn (when the provider reports it),
 *   emitted before `done`. Drives the context-usage indicator.
 * - `provider_switched` — the conversation moved to a different provider
 *   mid-session; renders a boundary divider and resets the context-usage window.
 * - `provider_error` — the turn's model request failed with a typed provider /
 *   auth / rate-limit / 5xx / network error; renders the matching inline card.
 *   This IS the failed turn's terminal frame: the turn's server deliberately
 *   skips the clean `done` after one (a `done` would settle the chat as a
 *   clean success — see session/exec-turn.ts), so consumers must treat
 *   `provider_error` as ending the turn.
 * - `file_changes` — user-visible workspace files this turn created/modified,
 *   emitted once before `done` (only when non-empty). Drives the "files this
 *   mission touched" summary.
 * - `done` / `error` — the turn ended.

/**
 * A conversation-stream frame: a WireEvent plus its position in the stream.
 * `seq` is per-conversation, strictly monotonic starting at 1, assigned at
 * publish time by the stream's ONE fan-out authority (the runtime's bus; the
 * host's turn relay for cloudrun conversations). The authority stamps every
 * frame itself — an upstream seq is never trusted or passed through, so there
 * is exactly one sequencing authority per stream. The counter lives for the
 * authority's process lifetime — it is never reset when the replay buffer is
 * cleared at turn end.
 *
 * `turnId` identifies the turn a frame belongs to. The turn's server mints one
 * id (a UUID) when the turn starts and stamps it on every turn-scoped frame it
 * publishes (`user`, `text`, `thinking`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `usage`,
 * `provider_switched`, `provider_error`, `file_changes`, `done`, `error` — including terminal
 * frames the relay synthesizes for a dead turn). The same id is persisted on
 * the turn's user + assistant `ChatMessage`s, so a client resyncing across a
 * turn boundary can match history to a live turn — and, crucially, can tell a
 * frame from ANOTHER writer's turn (a teammate, a second tab, a routine) apart
 * from its own instead of splicing it in. `sync` frames carry the running
 * turn's id inside `data.turnId` instead of the envelope.
 *
 * Resume: each frame is written with an SSE `id: <seq>` line, and a client
 * reconnects with `?after=<seq>` or the standard `Last-Event-ID` header
 * (header wins — it is the fresher signal, and the cloud gateway advances it
 * past its own replay while the original query param rides along unchanged). Frames still inside the server's replay window (the in-flight turn,
 * capped) are re-sent in order — no gap, no duplicate, no `sync`. A cursor
 * that cannot be served (older than the window, or from before a restart)
 * gets a fresh `sync` carrying `resync: true` + the current watermark instead.
 *
 * `seq` and `turnId` are optional on the type for wire compatibility only:
 * the server always sets `seq` on conversation event streams, and always
 * stamps `turnId` on turn-scoped frames.
