/**
 * C8 Spaces state — the CROSS-org surface `GET /v1/orgs` serves: every team the
 * caller belongs to, plus every pending invite addressed to them (the
 * invitee-side inbox the sidebar renders under its top line).
 *
 * Memberships have ONE source of truth here: the armed team-space rows
 * (`state.teamWorkspaces` — the same rows `GET /v1/workspaces` bridges). So
 * accepting an invite appends a row and the team appears in the switcher AND in
 * the org list at once, exactly as it does behind the real gateway, with no
 * second fixture to keep in sync.
 *
 * No PERSONAL `OrgSummary` is synthesized. The gateway lists one, but the fake
 * host's personal space is the seed WORKSPACE (`SEED_WORKSPACE_ID`), not an org
 * record with a slug — inventing one would put an id in `/v1/orgs` that
 * `/v1/workspaces` contradicts. Every client surface reading this list filters
 * to `kind:"team"` (the team picker) or matches the ACTIVE team's slug (the
 * degraded banner), so the omission is unobservable.
 *
 * The `FakeSpaceInvite` / `SpaceInviteRejection` shapes live in
 * `state-store.ts` with the rest of the wire fixtures; this module is their
 * read/write surface, mirroring `state-teams.ts`.
