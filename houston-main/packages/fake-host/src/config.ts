 * the default from the worktree path makes every checkout land on its own
 * ports with zero configuration; the env overrides still win when set.
 *
 * The root is found by walking up from cwd to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — every
 * process that resolves ports (playwright main, its workers, the standalone
 * fake host, vite) runs from somewhere inside the worktree, so they all agree.
 *
 * 100 buckets, NOT more: every derived port must stay below 32768, the floor
 * of Linux's default ephemeral range (net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range). A derived
 * port inside that range is a flake factory — any earlier `bind(0)` listener
 * or even the port probe's own self-connect can occupy it, and Playwright's
 * pre-launch check then dies with "already used" before a single test runs
 * (CI shard failure on run 32522005259: the runner path hashed to 35620).
