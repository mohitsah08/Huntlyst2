// structure and swaps the hue for its accent, so a primary button reads as the
// same button in either mode: a solid accent pill in light, because a
// translucent fill on a light surface reads as a disabled control, and the
// frost pill tinted with the accent in dark, where the glass IS the structure
// the whole set is built on and a solid accent slab shouts over it.

 * palette owns, and steps toward white until it clears the body floor on both.
