 * Composer attachments — files the user drops on a chat message, uploaded INTO
 * the agent's workspace so the runtime's clamped file tools can Read them during
 * the turn.
 *
 * Storage: `<agentRoot>/uploads/<filename>`. `agentRoot` is
 * HOUSTON_WORKSPACE_DIR — the very root the runtime's WorkspaceGuard clamps to —
 * so the RELATIVE path we return (`uploads/<filename>`) is exactly what the
 * agent's Read tool resolves and is allowed to open. The frontend encodes that
 * path verbatim into the message text ("Read these attached files: …"), so what
 * we store and what we return MUST agree.
 *
 * `uploads` is a regular, VISIBLE workspace folder: uploads are permanent agent
 * context, not per-conversation scratch (HOU-706). The user sees them in the
 * Files tab, the agent can find them from ANY later conversation, and clearing
 * or deleting a chat never removes them. (The pre-HOU-706 layout — a hidden
 * `.attachments/<scopeId>/` dot-dir wiped on chat delete — made every upload
 * silently vanish from the user's point of view. Files already stored there
 * stay readable at their old paths; new uploads never land there.)
 *
 * Transport: base64 JSON (dependency-free, binary-safe — the same base64 path
 * `files/read` already uses). The body's `scopeId` is legacy: older hosts keyed
 * storage (and a DELETE route) on it. It is accepted and ignored so current
 * clients — which still send it to stay compatible with not-yet-updated cloud
 * pods — never 400.
