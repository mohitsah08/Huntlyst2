/**
 * Backfill `created_by` on routines recorded before gateway-fronted pods
 * stamped acting identities.
 *
 * The control-plane routine planner refuses to fire a routine whose snapshot
 * names no creator (there is no identity to re-authorize or bill the fired
 * turn against), so every such routine rides only the legacy pre-wake path —
 * and stops running entirely once pre-wake suppression turns on. The snapshot
 * is projected from this very file on its next store-sync upload, so stamping
 * here is the whole repair: no control-plane write is involved.
 *
 * The stamp is the ORG OWNER's canonical user id (the managed pod's owner env),
 * not a synthetic principal: fire-time delivery requires the acting identity
 * to equal `created_by`, and only a real directory user can be minted an
 * acting token — a synthetic sub would leave the routine exactly as unfireable
 * as no sub at all. Edits keep healing forward: any later verified actor
 * re-stamps the routine as usual.
 *
 * Idempotent and minimal: only entries with no non-empty `created_by` gain the
 * key; everything else in the doc — malformed entries included, they are the
 * read path's diagnostics to report — round-trips untouched, and a doc with
 * nothing to stamp is not rewritten.
