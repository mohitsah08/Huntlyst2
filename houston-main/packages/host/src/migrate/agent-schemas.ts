/**
 * Re-seed every existing agent's `.houston/<family>/<family>.schema.json` with
 * the schema THIS build ships.
 *
 * The schemas are seeded once, at agent creation (`seedSchemas`), and are app
 * data — not user data. So an agent created before a schema gained a field kept
 * a stale copy forever, and stale copies are not inert: the product prompt tells
 * the model to read the schema and match it exactly, and every family schema is
 * `additionalProperties: false`. An agent reading a pre-HOU-946 learnings schema
 * (no `taught_by` / `mission_id` / `mission_title`) would conclude the
 * host-stamped provenance is invalid and strip it back out.
 *
 * Idempotent and cheap: the file is written only when its content differs, so a
 * steady-state boot is one small read per family per agent and zero writes (and
 * zero watcher churn — this also runs before the watcher starts).
