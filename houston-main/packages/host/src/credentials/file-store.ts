/**
 * File-backed connect-once credential store for the LOCAL profile: the host —
 * not the agent — owns the user's subscription token, persisted to one JSON
 * file on the user's machine so a login survives an app restart. The refresh
 * token lives here (host-readable), never in a runtime's environment, so a
 * prompt-injected agent reading `env` finds only a short-lived access token —
 * the same Gate #2 guarantee as cloud, just single-tenant.
 *
 * SCOPE (HOU-976): rows are keyed by acting identity as well as (workspace,
 * provider). Desktop and self-host never carry one (the acting header is dropped
 * off the gateway — routes/agents.ts `trustedActingAs`), so their key AND their
 * on-disk record stay byte-identical to the pre-HOU-976 shape: an existing
 * credentials.json loads with no migration and never gains a field. Only a
 * member's row persists `scopeKey`, and only the profiles that can produce one
 * write it — the dev launcher runs the managed-cloud posture
 * (`HOUSTON_MANAGED_CLOUD=1`) without the credential-gateway env that would
 * select RemoteCredentialStore, so this adapter really does see members there.
