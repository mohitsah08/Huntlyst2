/**
 * Managed-pod active-time sampler.
 *
 * The gateway meters how long this pod is AWAKE from the outside; what it
 * cannot see is how much of that time the agent spent actually executing
 * (turns run inside the runtime subprocess — this host only has the `/busy`
 * probe). So the pod samples its own busy state every few seconds, accrues
 * per-UTC-day totals, and reports them CUMULATIVELY (per boot, per day) to the
 * gateway's pod-usage ingest. Cumulative + GREATEST-upsert server-side makes
 * at-least-once flushing exact: a lost response self-heals on the next flush
 * and a crash loses at most one flush interval.
 *
 * Every report also carries the pod's CURRENT busy state (`busy`): the
 * control plane labels a busy pod so a PodDisruptionBudget shields it from
 * node drains (PRODUCT-1782). That is why a busy edge always reports, even
 * when the floor delays it to the next sample: the label must follow the
 * turn, not the accounting.
 *
 * Constructed ONLY on managed cloud pods (the HOUSTON_CREDENTIALS_URL env
 * quadruple); desktop and self-host never build one. Reporting is accounting,
 * never load-bearing: every failure is logged and swallowed — this daemon has
 * no user action to surface to (the beta silent-failure rule's watcher/daemon
 * exception) and must never take a pod down.
