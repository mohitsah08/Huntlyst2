/**
 * Host credentials and deployment controls never belong to a runtime.
 *
 * The child env is the parent's MINUS {@link HOST_ONLY}, so a secret the host
 * was given cannot reach a model-directed process by inheritance: a managed
 * assistant pod carries the gateway credential that acts on the whole account
 * (`HOUSTON_ASSISTANT_TOKEN` + `HOUSTON_ASSISTANT_CP_URL`), and the role a
 * runtime is told is stamped per-spawn from the host's own decision
 * (`assistant-role.ts`) rather than inherited, so an ordinary agent on that pod
 * can never read itself as the coordinator.
 *
 * WHY A DENYLIST, with a guard: the runtime and the model stack under it read
 * environment this package cannot enumerate — every provider key, the proxy and
 * certificate variables a corporate network needs, PATH, HOME, the locale. An
 * allowlist would silently strip the next one and break an agent in a way no
 * test here could see. What CAN be enumerated is the other half: every
 * `HOUSTON_*` / `COMPOSIO_*` name the host itself reads, and every one
 * `@houston/domain` declares for the host to stamp. So each one is
 * classified exactly once — host-only below, or {@link RUNTIME_PASS_THROUGH} —
 * and `runtime-parent-env.source.test.ts` fails the build on a name that is
 * neither, which is what keeps the next host-only secret from defaulting to
 * "inherited".
