 * gateway and authorizes that gateway with the same per-boot token that
 * authorizes every one of its routes — so handing that pair to a runtime would
 * put a master credential in the environment of every agent on the machine,
 * readable with one `echo` from a bash tool. A runtime learns only its ROLE.
