/**
 * The OPEN RuntimeLauncher adapters run through the shared contract
 * (../testing/launcher-contract.ts → runRuntimeLauncherContract):
 *   - FakeLauncher (the cloud 3-state model used in tests), and
 *   - ProcessLauncher, driven through INJECTED doubles (a recording spawner + an
 *     instant health probe) so the contract is a pure unit test. No real
 *     subprocess is spawned here.
 *
 * The closed GkeLauncher, which ran the SAME contract plus an apiserver-object
 * reconcile/idempotency suite against a live cluster, was retired with
 * `@houston/host-cloud` (git history) — the shipped cloud launches engine pods
 * from the private gateway repo, which carries its own launcher and tests. The
 * contract stays open as the behavioral bar for any out-of-repo adapter.
 *
 * INTENTIONAL DIVERGENCES (NOT part of the shared contract — pinned per-impl in
 * fake.test.ts / process.test.ts and the divergence block below):
 *   - status's "absent" state. FakeLauncher models running → asleep → absent so
 *     destroy reports "absent" and sleeping an unknown agent THROWS.
 *     ProcessLauncher has no "absent": a laptop process is either up ("running")
 *     or not ("asleep"); sleeping an unknown agent is a silent no-op and destroy
 *     == sleep. The contract only asserts the running/asleep transitions both
 *     share, never the post-destroy state.
 *   - endpoint VALUE. Fake hands back one configurable URL; Process allocates a
 *     loopback port per spawn. The contract only requires a non-empty baseUrl +
 *     token, never a specific value.
