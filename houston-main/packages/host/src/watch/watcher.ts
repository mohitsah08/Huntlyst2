/**
 * Watches the local `~/.houston/workspaces` tree and emits reactivity events for
 * changes — so an agent (or the user) editing files directly shows up in the UI
 * with no write going through the host. The local counterpart of the cloud's
 * post-mutation emits; same HoustonEvent vocabulary, different detection.
 *
 * The recursion strategy (native on macOS/Windows, directory-only inotify on
 * Linux so a busy pod tree cannot exhaust the kernel watch budget — HOU-841)
 * lives in watch-tree.ts.
 *
 * Events are coalesced per (agentPath, type) over a short debounce so a burst of
 * writes (a routine run rewriting several files) yields one invalidation each.
