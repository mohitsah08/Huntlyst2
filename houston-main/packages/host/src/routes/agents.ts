/**
 * THE PER-AGENT RUNTIME SURFACE: `/agents/:agentId/<anything>` → the agent's
 * own engine, via the workspace's channel. The frontend points its runtime
 * client at `${controlPlaneUrl}/agents/${agentId}`, so chat turns, the SSE
 * event stream, and the provider connect flow all reach the engine under one
 * ownership check — run by the dispatcher, once, for this family and for every
 * host-served family declared ahead of it.
 *
 * Matching is `*rest`, so a rest nobody declared still reaches the engine and
 * gets the engine's own 404. The member list (agents-proxy-members.ts) is the
 * published surface, not the match.
