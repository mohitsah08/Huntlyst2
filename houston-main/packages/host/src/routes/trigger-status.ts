 *
 * This TS host is never a trigger BACKEND: managed cloud's Go control plane owns
 * Composio provisioning + live status and answers this route at its edge — it
 * never proxies here. So the only status this handler can report honestly is the
 * no-backend one: every trigger-bound routine is `error` with a human detail
 * (it cannot wake on a deployment that can't fire triggers).
 *
 * That no-backend answer is the `triggersEnabled === false` branch, kept
 * explicit so the route NEVER lies: on a deployment that CAN fire triggers we do
 * not fabricate a status — we fall through (return false) and leave the answer
 * to the real backend (today the gateway edge; a future in-host backend would
 * add its own branch here rather than inherit the unsupported answer).
