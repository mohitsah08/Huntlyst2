/**
 * Fail closed on agent-data writes once this pod has lost its object-store
 * write fence (PRODUCT-1706).
 *
 * A managed pod claims a per-agent write lease at boot; when a NEWER boot
 * takes it (a roll's replacement pod, a pool worker running the agent while
 * the registry called it asleep), the store answers this pod's syncs with 409
 * and the sync daemon halts for good — by design, it is no longer the writer.
 * But the gateway kept proxying to the pod, and the pod kept answering
 * routine/mission/config writes with 200: they landed on its own disk, showed
 * in every read served by that pod, and were gone the moment the pod was
 * recycled and the next one hydrated the store's copy. A routine edited to
 * 7:00 fired at 7:00 for days, then silently reverted to its old 11:30.
 *
 * The write is refused instead. The 503 carries a distinct reason (not the
 * gateway's waking shape), so the client shows its authored "couldn't save"
 * copy and reports it: a fenced pod still receiving writes is a bug we want
 * to see, never a quiet retry loop. Reads keep flowing — what the pod has is
 * still the freshest answer until it is recycled.
