/**
 * WHAT THE AGENT'S ENGINE SERVES, enumerated rather than waved at.
 *
 * The per-agent catch-all (routes/agents.ts) matches `*rest` and forwards
 * whatever it is handed, so this list never decides a match. It is the
 * published surface: the SDK parity gate reads it, and
 * routes/agents-proxy-members.test.ts proves it against packages/runtime's own
 * transport tables, which are the only place these pairs are implemented.
 *
 * Two engines answer them. The STANDING runtime (channel/proxy.ts → the pi
 * runtime's transport server) serves all of them; the CLOUDRUN dispatch
 * (turn/dispatch.ts + turn/dispatch-providers.ts), which reconstructs the same
 * wire surface from object storage and per-turn Cloud Run, serves the subset a
 * web client needs. Annotating each pair is what makes "the web client asked
 * for X and a cloudrun agent 404ed" a readable fact rather than a bug report.
