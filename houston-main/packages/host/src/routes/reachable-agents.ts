/**
 * WHICH agents a caller can address, and how a written reference matches one.
 *
 * The mission routes and assistant dispatcher share reference matching, but
 * their candidate sets deliberately differ for regular agents: missions stay
 * in the caller's workspace, while the AI Manager spans the owner's workspaces.
 *
 * The ladder itself lives in agent-refs.ts, over the flat shape a candidate in
 * another pod also has; this module answers only WHICH agents are candidates.
 *
 * This base directory spans the workspaces of the calling agent's owner.
 * Mission callers narrow it in missions-directory.ts.
 * Hidden dot-agents (the personal assistant itself, the setup runtime) are
 * synthetic and list-hidden by construction: they are not a place work can go
 * and never a target, so they are absent here and can never match.
