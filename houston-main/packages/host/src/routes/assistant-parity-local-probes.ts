/**
 * Every operation the local host answers, with the arguments to dispatch it.
 *
 * A probe asserts the ADDRESS resolves to a live handler that authored its own
 * answer — not that the call succeeds. So writes address things that do not
 * exist ("no-such-routine") or that the probes themselves own (the folder
 * below): the handler's own 404 or 400 proves the route as well as a 200 does,
 * and nothing the agent seeded is destroyed.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS for the Files block: it creates one folder, renames it, moves
 * it and deletes it, in that sequence, so each route acts on something real.
