/**
 * WHICH CONVERSATION EACH AGENT IS WORKING IN, held by the host.
 *
 * A runtime tells the host which conversation its turn belongs to by sending
 * `x-houston-conversation-id`. That is fine for anything the runtime is merely
 * describing to itself, and NOT fine for the three decisions that are about the
 * runtime rather than for it:
 *
 *  - Mission ancestry (`missions-start.ts`). The depth guard asks "is the chat
 *    this call comes from itself a mission?" - a question a caller that named a
 *    conversation of its own invention answers "no" forever, which is exactly
 *    the unbounded spawn loop the guard exists to prevent.
 *  - Plan mode (`plan-gate.ts`). Plan means the user asked for a proposal, not
 *    for work; a runtime that skipped its own mode check (a bug, a fork, a
 *    prompt-injected turn) must still not have the host act for it.
 *  - WHO the turn acts as (`missions-sandbox.ts`, `learnings-sandbox.ts`,
 *    `routines-sandbox.ts`). A loopback `/sandbox/*` call is not gateway-fronted,
 *    so an acting-as header arriving on one is the runtime's own word about
 *    whose name a mission or a learning is written in.
 *
 * So the host records all three itself, at the two places a turn actually
 * begins: the user's send (`routes/agents.ts`) and a programmatic fire - a
 * routine, a trigger, a mission's first turn - which every deployment routes
 * through its channel's `fireTurn` (`channel/proxy.ts`, `channel/turn.ts`).
 *
 * Records are kept PER CONVERSATION, and the caller has to name the one it is
 * speaking in: two chats with the same agent run their own turns, and a record
 * keyed by the agent alone would let the second send re-label the first turn's
 * mode and lineage. A turn's record is dropped when the runtime reports that
 * turn ending (`/sandbox/missions/settle`), so a call arriving after the work
 * is over is refused rather than served against a turn that no longer runs.
