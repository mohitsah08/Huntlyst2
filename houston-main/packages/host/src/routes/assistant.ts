/**
 * Discovery for the user's personal assistant: `GET /v1/assistant` answers
 * WHICH agent holds it and WHICH conversation to open.
 *
 * The assistant is not a new chat surface. It is a special HIDDEN AGENT
 * reached through the same per-agent session routes every other agent uses, so
 * the only thing a client cannot work out for itself is its address — and that
 * is all this route serves.
 *
 * Desktop / self-host: the agent is the synthetic dot-named `.assistant` in the
 * user's personal workspace, following the hidden setup runtime's precedent
 * (`routes/setup-runtime.ts`) — a dot name is list-hidden by construction
 * (`store/local.ts` lists only dot-less directories), and `validateAgentName`
 * refuses a leading dot, so no user action can create it, rename another agent
 * onto it, or make it show up in the sidebar. It gets no `.houston` seeding:
 * the assistant performs Houston operations for the user, it does not keep a
 * board of its own.
 *
 * Gateway-fronted (a managed cloud pod): the GATEWAY owns discovery — it alone
 * knows which pod holds this user's assistant, which a single pod cannot. 501
 * is the honest answer; a second, divergent implementation here would be worse
 * than none. A deployment with no agent tree of its own answers 501 too, with
 * its own code: both are "this engine does not implement discovery", and both
 * are permanent for the session.
