/**
 * The RUNTIME-facing memory write route (`POST /sandbox/learnings/save`, authed
 * by the per-sandbox HMAC token). The agent's `save_learning` tool calls THIS
 * instead of editing `.houston/learnings/learnings.json` with file tools.
 *
 * WHY it exists (two reasons, mirroring routines-sandbox.ts):
 *  1. MERGE SAFETY. A wholesale file write drops every entry the model did not
 *     happen to read back. This route read-modify-writes (loadLearnings →
 *     append → saveLearnings), so a save never clobbers existing memory.
 *  2. PROVENANCE. Every learning should say who taught it and which mission it
 *     came from — facts the agent cannot know and must not be trusted to write.
 *     They are derived HERE from the host's own record of the running turn
 *     (routes/live-turn.ts): the person the gateway vouched for when the turn
 *     began, and the mission that turn's conversation belongs to.
 *
 * Stamping semantics:
 *  - `taught_by` ONLY when `deps.gatewayFronted`. Off the gateway (desktop /
 *    self-host) there is only one human anyway — so no identity key is written
 *    at all and a single-player learnings.json keeps exactly the shape it has
 *    today. ON the gateway with no acting-as token (a FIRED ROUTINE has no
 *    driving human) the routine creator's sub, recorded by the fire that started
 *    the turn, is the author, so a routine-taught learning is never anonymous in
 *    Teams.
 *  - `mission_id` + `mission_title` whenever the conversation matches a mission,
 *    on EVERY deployment: a mission is not an identity, and "from the Q3
 *    pipeline mission" is the more useful half of provenance for a solo user.
 *    No conversation id, or no matching mission (a routine run, a chat with no
 *    board row) → no mission keys.
 *  - Everything is best-effort metadata: a failure to resolve the mission must
 *    never cost the user their learning, so the mission lookup is swallowed and
 *    the learning is saved without it.
