/**
 * Sandbox-facing: the runtime reporting that a PROVIDER revoked the token this
 * host served it.
 *
 * A revoked token is not an expired one. Nothing on the serve path can see the
 * difference — the credential is present, unexpired, and refreshing it would
 * succeed or fail for unrelated reasons — so the store keeps handing the dead
 * token to every runtime in the workspace and every turn 401s until the clock
 * runs out. Sentry HOUSTON-APP-4YA: 3,935 failed turns across 58 users, all on
 * managed-cloud pods. The runtime's turn is the only witness, and this route is
 * how its testimony reaches the store (HOU-952).
 *
 * The report names the token by digest, never by value, and the store's
 * compare-and-delete drops it only while it is still the stored one — a report
 * from a turn that began before the user reconnected must not delete the
 * credential they just created.
 *
 * Returns true when the request was handled.
