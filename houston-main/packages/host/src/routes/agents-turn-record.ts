 */

/**
 * WHICH CONVERSATION THIS AGENT IS WORKING IN, recorded by the host rather than
 * taken from the runtime's word for it (routes/live-turn.ts): the mission depth
 * guard and the assistant's plan-mode gate are both about the runtime, so
 * neither may be answered by it. The mode is read only for the coordinator, the
 * one agent whose operations the host itself performs — every other agent's
 * send reaches the channel with its body untouched.
 *
 * A RETRY of a message the runtime already took records nothing: the turn it
 * started is the live one, and restarting it here would move the mode and the
 * depth guard onto a turn nobody sent.
 *
 * WHO the turn acts as is recorded with it: the gateway-minted token this
 * request arrived with (undefined off the gateway, where an inbound acting
 * header is untrusted client input). The `/sandbox/*` routes this turn calls
 * back into read it from here rather than from their own request, which the
 * runtime writes and could name anyone in.
 *
 * The provider pair the send asked for is recorded too: a routine the agent
 * saves during this turn inherits it (routines-sandbox.ts). The body is the
 * shared memo (turn-body.ts), so reading it here costs nothing downstream and
 * the engine still receives the same bytes.
