/**
 * The RUNTIME-facing scheduled-task write route (`POST /sandbox/routines/save`,
 * authed by the per-sandbox HMAC token). The agent's `save_routine` tool calls
 * THIS instead of writing `.houston/routines/routines.json` with file tools.
 *
 * WHY it exists: each setup chat is isolated and only knows its own routine, so a
 * wholesale file write (the old prompt) made creating task #2 overwrite task #1.
 * This route merge-saves through the SAME read-modify-write the authenticated
 * agent-data route uses (loadRoutines -> create/apply -> upsertById ->
 * saveRoutines), so a second write never clobbers a first. The gate + write live
 * in routine-write.ts; this handler only resolves the sandbox to its workspace
 * and relays validation errors as tool-actionable JSON.
 *
 * A body with an `id` updates that routine in place; without one it creates a new
 * routine alongside the existing set.
