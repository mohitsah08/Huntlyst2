 * "only the user moves a card to done" - the user delegated the review to the
 * agent (PRODUCT-1244's planning-agent flow), the move is an explicit tool call
 * visible in the parent chat, and the guards below keep it away from anything
 * still running and from the agent's own conversation (which the turn's settle
 * would immediately contradict).
 *
 * An optional `agent` moves a card on ANOTHER agent's board - the settle half
 * of a mission the caller started there. That board is reached wherever it
 * lives: on this disk, or over the wire in the agent's own pod, which applies
 * the very same move with the very same guards.
