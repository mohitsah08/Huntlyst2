/**
 * Teams attribution: stamp the acting human as a contributor on the mission a
 * turn is driving, AND record the teammates that turn @mentioned (HOU-945).
 * Called only when a gateway-injected acting-as identity is present (hosted
 * Teams) — off the gateway `author` is null and nothing runs, so single-player
 * activity.json stays byte-identical.
 *
 * The mission is matched by the conversation id: a mission's `session_key` (the
 * turn's conversation), with `activity-<id>` as the fallback for missions whose
 * key was never persisted separately. Both upserts return the SAME reference
 * when they change nothing, so an unchanged mission skips the disk write — and
 * both run over ONE load→save→emit pass, never two writes and never two events.
 *
 * INVARIANT: attribution is metadata — a stamping failure must NEVER block or
 * fail the turn. Everything here is best-effort and swallowed with a log; the
 * turn's own dispatch owns the user-visible outcome.
