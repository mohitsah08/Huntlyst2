/**
 * The decisive regression guard for the generated catalog: every routable
 * operation's address must resolve to a real handler on the SAME host the app
 * talks to. The catalog is derived from the engine adapter, and the adapter,
 * the local host and the hosted gateway all serve one surface — so a catalog
 * path the local host cannot address is a generator bug, not a variant.
 *
 * `/agents/:id/<anything>` is a CATCH-ALL that proxies whatever it does not
 * recognise to the agent's runtime, so "no 404" alone proves nothing. The
 * spawner below therefore serves a real sentinel, and an answer carrying it
 * came from the RUNTIME rather than from the host. For an operation the host
 * serves itself that is a failure — the address fell THROUGH the route table.
 * For the few whose route is a published member of the runtime-proxy family
 * (routes/agents-proxy-members.ts) it is the pass: `proxied()` marks those, and
 * the sentinel is the proof the host relayed them to the engine that owns them.
