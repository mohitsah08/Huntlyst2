/**
 * What the parity suite drives, and the vocabulary the probe tables share.
 *
 * The generated catalog describes ONE surface that the local host and the
 * hosted gateway both serve. The tables are how that claim stays true: every
 * routable operation the assistant can call is named in exactly one of them,
 * and the suite asserts that coverage is complete — a new annotated operation
 * that nobody probed fails the build rather than shipping unexercised.
 *
 * Three tables, because there are three honest answers to "what happens when
 * the local host is asked to perform this?":
 *
 * - `LOCAL_PROBES` (./assistant-parity-local-probes) — it answers, out of its
 *   own handler or, for a route it publishes as the agent engine's
 *   (`proxied`), by relaying to that engine.
 * - `CLOUD_ONLY_PROBES` (./assistant-parity-cloud-probes) — it legitimately
 *   does not, and the probe asserts the miss so a path that starts resolving
 *   locally shows up as the drift it is.
 * - `WRITE_DRIVEN_OPERATIONS` — driven end to end by the write suite, which
 *   proves the method, the body mapping and the id round-trip rather than just
 *   the address.
