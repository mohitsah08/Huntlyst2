 *
 * Rejects with `LauncherClosedError` while the host drains: a heal reads the
 * runtime's live credential, and a draining host has latched its launcher and
 * is killing that very runtime. The runtime's own serve sync is what arrives
 * here mid-drain (it probes every provider at once), so without this every
 * roll logged one Sentry error per provider per pod, fleet-wide, for a state
 * that is nothing but the shutdown (PRODUCT-1672). The rejection rides to the
 * server's catch, which answers 503 + Retry-After — the runtime's probe reads
 * that as transient and keeps its copy, instead of a marked 404 it would act
 * on as a verdict.
 *
 * A network failure on a LIVE host is reported once per runtime per incident:
 * the runtime's sync probes every known provider (40+, 8 at a time), and each
 * miss heals through the same runtime socket, so a stalled or unreachable
 * runtime logged one Sentry error per provider — the HOUSTON-APP-5AD bucket
 * (PRODUCT-1687). The first failure stays a loud error naming the cause; the
 * rest of the incident is a warn breadcrumb.
 *
 * A rename is the drain's small sibling: the launcher sleeps the runtime and
 * latches its id while the directory moves, and the dying runtime's serve
 * sync (every provider at once) misses into this healer with the OLD id. The
 * launcher's `AgentRenamingError` rides to the route's 503 the same way, with
 * no cooldown spent: the respawned runtime under the new id heals on its
 * first miss (PRODUCT-1804: 29 Sentry errors for one rename).
