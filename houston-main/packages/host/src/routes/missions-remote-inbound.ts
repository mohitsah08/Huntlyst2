/**
 * The mission family on the PER-AGENT surface — `/agents/{id}/missions…`,
 * served for one agent to the caller already authorized for it:
 *
 *   POST /agents/{id}/missions/start   start a mission on this agent's board
 *   GET  /agents/{id}/missions         this agent's board
 *   GET  /agents/{id}/missions/read    one mission's transcript
 *   POST /agents/{id}/missions/status  move a mission on this agent's board
 *
 * In managed cloud each agent is its own pod. The AI Manager and regular agent
 * callers address another board through the gateway, which dispatches here.
 * The running cap, row, reactivity event, first turn, and rollback happen on
 * the pod that owns the board.
 *
 * The gateway authorizes the user, AI Manager, or agent caller for this target.
 * A verified calling-agent header stamps origin_agent and grants that caller
 * move rights on its own missions. The body supplies the parent session and
 * depth, which this pod checks because it cannot read the parent chat.
