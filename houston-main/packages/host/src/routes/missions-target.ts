/**
 * WHICH agent's board a mission call acts on. Absent → the calling agent's own
 * board (every agent's own missions, unchanged). Present → the named agent's,
 * which is what the personal assistant needs: it keeps no board of its own, so
 * the work it starts must land where the user actually sees it.
 *
 * Resolution is fail-closed and scoped to what the CALLER can already reach:
 * the agents in this host, plus — in managed cloud, where every agent is its
 * own pod — the agents the gateway lists for the user (missions-directory.ts).
 * A name that resolves to nothing answers with the names that WOULD resolve,
 * and a name that resolves to SEVERAL is refused with the qualified names that
 * separate them, so the model corrects itself instead of guessing again.
 *
 * A resolved target is either local (the handler retargets its ctx and stays
 * target-blind) or remote (the call travels to that agent's pod,
 * missions-remote.ts). Refusals are values carrying a code.
