/**
 * WHAT THE COORDINATOR MAY REACH on the runtime-facing `/sandbox/*` surface.
 *
 * Every `/sandbox/*` route authenticates the same way: a valid HMAC sandbox
 * token, which every runtime this host spawns carries. That is the right gate
 * for an ordinary agent, whose sandbox token is exactly its reach. It is NOT
 * the right gate for the personal assistant: the coordinator is a runtime the
 * user talks to about their whole account, so a prompt injection inside its
 * chat reaches whatever its token reaches. Without this gate that includes
 * writing a scheduled task and executing a connected app - neither of which
 * the coordinator has a tool for, and both of which the catalogued surface
 * would have required an approval receipt for (`assistant/approvals.ts`).
 *
 * So the coordinator's reach is stated ONCE, here, as an allowlist keyed on the
 * claim rather than on the route: its own Houston operations, the mission board
 * it delegates work through, its own memory document, its transcript recall,
 * and the read-only provider status its turns run on. Everything else answers
 * 403 `coordinator_scope`.
 *
 * Ordinary agents are untouched: the gate only fires for a claim that IS the
 * coordinator (the `.assistant` dot-agent locally, the single agent of an
 * assistant pod - `routes/assistant-claim.ts` owns that decision, and it is the
 * same decision the assistant surface itself is authorized by).
 */

/**
 * The route families the coordinator reaches, matched against the request path.
 *
 * `/sandbox/credential` and `/sandbox/credential/revoked` are on the list
 * because they are how ANY runtime, coordinator included, is served the model
 * credential its own turn runs on - withholding them would leave the assistant
 * unable to answer at all. They serve only the claim's own agent, so they hand
 * the coordinator nothing beyond its own turn.
