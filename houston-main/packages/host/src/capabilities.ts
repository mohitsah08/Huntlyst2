/**
 * The two deployment capability profiles, in ONE place so the host, the local
 * sidecar entry, and the dual-profile parity gate all read the same source of
 * truth (no second copy to drift). `/v1/capabilities` serves one of these; the
 * UI gates affordances on these flags, never on a hardcoded "am I web/desktop".
 *
 * The asymmetries are deliberate and contained here (the irreducible local↔cloud
 * differences from the convergence plan): local has the Tauri shell + the user's
 * own machine (reveal-in-OS, terminal). Every profile offers the SAME connect-once
 * / API-key providers AND the OpenAI-compatible (bring-your-own endpoint) provider
 * (`openaiCompatible`): a cloud pod now accepts a public HTTPS endpoint the user
 * hosts (a tunnel or a directly hosted server), so it is no longer desktop-only —
 * the old "cloud can't reach the user's localhost" rationale is superseded. What
 * differs is validation, not availability: a managed cloud pod egresses ONLY to
 * public TCP 443, so it validates the base URL at save time (custom-endpoint
 * validation in routes/agents.ts) while desktop/self-host keep accepting
 * localhost. Everything NOT listed here is shared behavior served by the same
 * handlers — that's what `dual-profile.test.ts` pins.

/**
 * Every model provider Houston serves, as a capabilities HINT. Derived from
 * pi-ai's baked provider registry (sorted for a stable order) so it CANNOT drift
 * from the real runnable set — the authoritative list is `GET /v1/catalog`
 * (`providers/pi-catalog.ts`), which enumerates the same registry. Shared by all
 * profiles: the managed cloud pod runs the same host/runtime as desktop and its
 * egress reaches every provider, so cloud and desktop offer the identical set.
 * The OpenAI-compatible (BYO endpoint) provider is NOT here — it is a Houston
 * concept, not a pi-ai provider, and rides the separate `openaiCompatible` flag
 * because it carries a base URL + model, not a credential.
