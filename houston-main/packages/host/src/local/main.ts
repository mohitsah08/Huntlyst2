/**
 * The local host entry point — the desktop sidecar the Tauri shell spawns. Same
 * host server, local adapter profile. The shell parses the `HOUSTON_HOST_LISTENING`
 * banner for {port, token}, exactly as it parses the runtime's today.
 *
 * Config (env, all optional):
 *   HOUSTON_HOME              ~/.houston (base for the three paths below)
 *   HOUSTON_WORKSPACES_ROOT   ~/.houston/workspaces
 *   HOUSTON_CREDENTIALS_PATH  ~/.houston/credentials.json
 *   HOUSTON_AGENTS_DIR        ~/.houston/agents (installed agent-config library)
 *   HOUSTON_CHAT_HISTORY_DB   ~/.houston/db/houston.db (Rust-era chat to migrate)
 *   HOUSTON_HOST_PORT         4318
 *   HOUSTON_HOST_BIND         127.0.0.1 (desktop). Self-host on a VPS sets
 *                             0.0.0.0 to expose it behind a TLS reverse proxy.
 *   HOUSTON_HOST_TOKEN        random per boot (set a fixed one for self-host)
 *   HOUSTON_CREDENTIALS_URL   managed pod only: gateway base URL for org credentials
 *   HOUSTON_ORG_SLUG          managed pod only: org slug for org credentials
 *   HOUSTON_AGENT_SLUG        managed pod only: agent slug for org credentials
 *   HOUSTON_RUNTIME_COMMAND   argv to launch a pi-runtime (space-separated);
 *                             explicit override (highest priority). Otherwise:
 *                             the compiled sidecar spawns ITSELF (in runtime
 *                             role via HOUSTON_SIDECAR_ROLE — see host.ts);
 *                             bundled Docker spawns dist/runtime/main.mjs; dev
 *                             falls back to `node --import tsx <repo>/packages/runtime/src/main.ts`.
 *   HOUSTON_APP_SYSTEM_PROMPT the product voice prompt (from the app)
 *   HOUSTON_MANAGED_CLOUD=1  serve managed-cloud capabilities (K8s pod)
 *   HOUSTON_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_MS  managed pod only: how long a shutdown lets
 *                            in-flight turns finish (termination grace minus
 *                            the final sync's share); unset = short default
 *   HOUSTON_OAUTH_CALLBACK_BASE_URL  self-host only: the public origin for the
 *                             custom-integration OAuth callback (PRODUCT-1172)
 *   HOUSTON_PASSIVE=1        migration-source mode: no scheduler, no watcher
 *   HOUSTON_ROUTINE_SCHEDULER_MODE  local (default) | external (managed pod
 *                             only; disables cron fires, keeps reconcile)
 *   HOUSTON_STORE_URL         managed pod only: object-store gateway base URL
 *   HOUSTON_TRANSCRIPT_DUAL_WRITE=1  file-first transcript/doc DB shadow
 *   HOUSTON_TURN_LOG=1        relay-frame batches to managed turnlog ingest
