/**
 * The LOCAL adapter profile's two assembled-over-HTTP claims that the
 * dual-profile parity gate cannot reach — both proven against a REAL filesystem
 * (FsVfs + FsWatcher), with the fake spawner, with NO real provider or runtime:
 *
 *   1. A skill created via the API lands at the EXACT on-disk path pi reads
 *      (`<W>/<A>/.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`). The dual-profile test pins the
 *      WIRE behavior, but normalizes ids and runs cloud against MemoryVfs; it
 *      never asserts the byte file exists where the next pi session loads it.
 *      "Created in the UI → the agent uses it next turn" is exactly that file
 *      being on disk, so this is the local analog of Layer-3 checklist row 4
 *      that DOESN'T need a turn.
 *
 *   2. A raw write under an agent's `.houston` surfaces the correct HoustonEvent
 *      on `/v1/events` — the FsWatcher → EventHub → SSE keystone, ASSEMBLED.
 *      The watcher unit test stops at the callback; the events-stream test
 *      drives only the cloud host-mutation path (MemoryVfs, no watcher). This is
 *      the local profile's whole reactivity story (the analog of cloud's
 *      post-turn synthetic sync — see the documented asymmetry) and the thing
 *      that makes "edit a file → the board updates with no refresh" true, so it
 *      must be machine-checked before engine/ (the watcher's parity oracle) goes.
