 * scheduled tick and a hand-pressed "run now" both go through, so an on-demand
 * run is indistinguishable from a cron one (same run record, same firer, same
 * reconcile-driven completion).
 *
 * Per-routine in-flight gate (parity with the Rust create_if_routine_idle): a
 * routine whose previous run is still going never double-fires into the same
 * conversation. The gate + record write run under the per-agent runs-file
 * queue (runs-lock.ts), so a scheduler tick racing a hand-pressed "run now"
 * can't both pass the gate or drop each other's rows. A stuck "running" row
 * can't wedge the gate forever — reconcile times a reply-less run out and
 * errors it.
 *
 * The "running" run is persisted FIRST (so the board shows it immediately and a
 * fire failure has a record to mark), then the turn is started OUTSIDE the
 * queue (a cold start must never block a cancel). A fire failure marks the run
 * errored — never stuck "running", never a silent miss — and re-throws so an
 * HTTP caller can surface the real reason to the user (the scheduler, having
 * no UI thread, catches + logs it instead).
