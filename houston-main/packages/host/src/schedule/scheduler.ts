 * delivery carries the routine creator's minted acting identity, so its turn
 * resolves the creator's own credentials; the pod-local path can only run on
 * the shared team scope (pods cannot mint identity — HOU-976 D10), where a
 * member's personally-connected provider reads as "not connected". Racing the
 * delivery at second granularity made WHICH credentials a run used depend on
 * scheduler load: at the top of the hour the delivery lags behind the herd of
 * due routines, the local scan won the per-instant dedup burn, and the run
 * failed no_provider (PRODUCT-1549). The grace keeps the local cron as a
 * genuine backstop: it fires only instants the external delivery has left
 * unclaimed for this long. Must stay well under the dedup TTL and above the
 * delivery's worst observed top-of-hour lag (~15s).

 * by construction — the due instant is the cron time (replica-independent), so
 * a per-(routine, instant) `setNx` lock lets only one replica fire. No leader
 * election; every replica scans, the lock arbitrates.
 *
 * Deployment-agnostic: cloud and local inject their own RoutineFirer + lock
 * (Redis vs in-process). lastTick resets to `now` on start, so a freshly
 * started replica never replays history.
 *
 * The sweep is fail-isolated at every level (HOU-953): a workspace or agent
 * that throws is logged and skipped, never allowed to abort the tick. `lastTick`
 * has already advanced by then, so an escaping throw would drop that window's
 * instants for every agent behind it — permanently, and silently.
