/**
 * Attach each custom action's input schema to its search match.
 *
 * `executor.tools.list()` returns only the invocation columns (address, name,
 * description, annotations) — never `input_schema` — so a match built from
 * the listing has no `inputParams` and the model sees the action with NO
 * parameters (PRODUCT-1841). In chat the model guesses the body from the
 * description; a routine told never to invent parameters stops with an
 * error instead. The schema lives behind `tools.schema(address)`, so every
 * action row is hydrated from it before the result leaves the provider.
 * App rows (action "") have no schema; a match that already carries one
 * keeps it; a null view (address gone) leaves the row as it was.
 *
 * The executor hoists a spec's shared component schemas into definition
 * rows and hands them back as `schemaDefinitions`, so a schema whose body is
 * `$ref: "#/$defs/X"` is only whole with them re-attached as `$defs` — the
 * model cannot expand a dangling ref. One `tools.schema` call per matched
 * action row (at most the provider's 20 matches), in parallel.
