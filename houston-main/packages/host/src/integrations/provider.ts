 *                  driving THIS turn (a normal message dispatch).
 *  - `actingUser`: the Supabase `sub` of a routine's creator (routine turns,
 *                  where no per-turn token is minted — see C2 "Routine path").
 *
 * The direct adapter (self-host, own key) ignores both — identity is the

 * (which holds the key and re-derives the userId from the Supabase JWT), so the
 * platform key never ships in a client binary. Self-hosters point the direct
