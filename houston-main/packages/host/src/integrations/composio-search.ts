/**
 * The Composio search algorithm, extracted from the adapter so composio.ts stays
 * request-shaping + port-mapping and this holds the discovery policy (and its
 * pure, unit-testable pieces). Status stamping lives in composio-annotate.ts.
 *
 * Discovery is PROGRESSIVE (PRODUCT-1274): a query that names an app gets that
 * app's actions scoped hard to it, never a globally ranked list where unrelated
 * connected apps drown the named one out. The lookups, merged in this order:
 *
 *  1. NAMED-APP lookups — the explicit `app` scope (the agent's hard filter),
 *     or apps resolved from the query text. Each runs the query scoped to that
 *     toolkit; a zero score degrades to LISTING the toolkit's actions when the
 *     scope is explicit OR the named app is CONNECTED (Composio's full-text
 *     scores everyday phrasings at zero; direct toolkit retrieval is its own
 *     deterministic fallback — "En Clockify, dime cuánto tiempo he registrado"
 *     must surface Clockify's real slugs in THIS search, not after a scoped
 *     re-search). With an explicit scope these lookups are the WHOLE result.
 *  2. A query scoped to the user's CONNECTED toolkits — high precision for apps
 *     they already have. When it scores zero, degrade to listing those
 *     toolkits' actions so an everyday phrasing still lands on a real slug.
 *  3. Query-resolved apps that are NOT connected — after the connected results
 *     (a loose text match must never outrank the app the user actually uses)
 *     and without the listing fallback (their toolkit row + an `app`-scoped
 *     re-search cover that).
 *  4. A GLOBAL query — so a connected-Gmail user asking for Google Sheets still
 *     discovers it. This ALWAYS runs; it is never short-circuited by (2).
 *  5. Catalog resolution — an app named in the query is resolved against the
 *     toolkits catalog and surfaced as a toolkit-level entry even when no
 *     action scored, so the model always learns the slug for
 *     request_connection. This is what makes "connect to Google Sheets" work.
