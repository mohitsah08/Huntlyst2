 * paths, no route that mutates or streams. `rest` is the dispatch remainder
 * (routes/agents.ts, routes/setup-runtime.ts), i.e. no leading slash.

/**
 * Wake the agent's runtime for one dispatched request, and say where to reach

 * must stop.
 *
 * Everything but a read-only probe awaits the wake outright: a turn, an SSE
 * subscription or a login has nothing useful to say before its runtime is up.
 * A probe instead RACES the wake against a short deadline and, when the boot is
 * slower, answers 503 + `Retry-After` so the socket is freed in milliseconds
 * instead of minutes (the provider picker's spinner used to sit on exactly
 * this, for a full cold boot, on every zero-provider desktop launch).
 *
 * Two properties make that safe:
 * - The boot is NEVER aborted. `ensureAwake` keeps running in the background,
 *   so the client's retry a couple of seconds later meets a live runtime rather
 *   than paying for a fresh cold start.
 * - It cannot double-spawn. `ensureAwake` is single-flight per agent
 *   (launcher/process.ts `booting`), so the retry — and every other caller
 *   arriving meanwhile — joins the SAME spawn.
 *
 * The launcher's own `status` is deliberately not consulted: mid-boot it
 * already reports "running" (the live-set entry exists before the child is
 * healthy), which is exactly the case this guards. A warm runtime costs nothing
 * here — `ensureAwake` resolves at once and wins the race.
