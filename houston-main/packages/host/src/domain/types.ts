/**
 * The control-plane tenancy model — deliberately small for the free personal tier.
 *
 *   Workspace — a user's container of agents. Today every workspace is `personal`:
 *               free, single-player. Its owner sees and uses ALL its agents; nobody
 *               else can. The paid multiplayer "org" kind (members + per-seat) is
 *               modeled by `kind` but NOT implemented yet.
 *   Agent     — belongs to one workspace; maps to exactly one sandbox + one volume.
 *
 * There is no permission/grant layer in personal mode: access is pure ownership
 * (do you own this agent's workspace?). The wall BETWEEN agents is the per-agent
 * sandbox (its own volume + default-deny networking), never a row in a table.
