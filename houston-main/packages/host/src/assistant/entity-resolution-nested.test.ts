/**
 * IDENTIFIERS THAT ARRIVE INSIDE A BODY, and the two shapes they arrive in.
 *
 * The resolver used to read top-level string parameters and nothing else, so a
 * manifest's list of skills, a list of people, and every field of a body object
 * reached the approval card and the request exactly as the model wrote them:
 * checked against nothing, presented to the user as fact. These pin the walk
 * that closes it - one level in, lists included - and pin that a value nothing
 * matches is refused with the values that do exist.
