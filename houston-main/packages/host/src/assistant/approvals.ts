/**
 * Where a destructive Houston operation's approval actually lives: in the HOST,
 * the process that holds the credential that would perform it.
 *
 * The rule: THE MODEL CANNOT MINT AN APPROVAL. The host issues a `requestId`
 * when it raises an approval card; the only thing that turns that id into a
 * usable receipt is the USER's own next message arriving on the host's
 * conversation-message route (`assistant/receipts.ts`), which no runtime
 * can author. The runtime's `houston_call` then presents the id back, and the
 * host — not the runtime — decides whether it may proceed.
 *
 * Every field of a record is a way for an approval to authorize the wrong thing,
 * so each one is checked at consume time:
 * - KEY: sha256 of the operation name plus its canonicalized arguments, so
 *   approving "delete Personal/Dobby" approves nothing else. It is recomputed
 *   from the params SUBMITTED with the call, so changed bytes are a new ask.
 * - REQUEST ID: 128 bits of randomness the model never sees until the host
 *   mints it, so an old reply cannot be replayed into a new grant.
 * - CONVERSATION + AGENT (`approval-scope.ts`): approving in one chat authorizes
 *   nothing in another, and an unattended turn (a routine, fired straight at the
 *   runtime) never travels the message route at all, so it never inherits one.
 * - SINGLE USE: {@link ApprovalStore.consume} removes the record it returns.
 * - SHORT LIVED: an approval the user gave and the model sat on is not an
 *   approval any more.
 *
 * Held in memory on purpose: a host restart drops every pending approval, which
 * fails CLOSED (the user is asked again). Persisting them would mean an
 * approval that outlives the conversation the person was looking at.
