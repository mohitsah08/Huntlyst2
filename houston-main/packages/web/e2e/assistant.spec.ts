/**
 * The personal assistant: a rail row and an infinite 1-on-1 chat behind it.
 *
 * Discovery (`GET /v1/assistant`) supplies the conversation address. This
 * spec covers the shell behavior around that chat:
 * 1. the Manager is pinned above agent groups and opens a full-window chat;
 * 2. an empty thread introduces the assistant instead of showing skill cards —
 *    a 1-on-1 chat opens on the composer, not on a menu;
 * 3. the conversation creates NO activity, so it never appears as a board card.
 * 4. what discovery's own answers do to the surface: absence takes the row away
 *    silently, a failure keeps it and says so.
