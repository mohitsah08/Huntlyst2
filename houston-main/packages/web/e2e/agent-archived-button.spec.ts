/**
 * The board's archived-mission control and its reset contract. There is ONE
 * archive — the cross-agent one every board renders — and every board belongs
 * to an employee, so all three tests drive the employee's. It is a MODE of
 * Tasks: the active toolbar's "Archived" button swaps it in, its own "Back to
 * tasks" swaps it out, and no lozenge of the employee's strip names it.
 *
 * They pin two different exits. Leaving for another SECTION of the same
 * employee unmounts the archive (the sections swap), so coming back has to
 * start on the ACTIVE board. Leaving for another TOP-LEVEL view does not: the
 * employee screen is KEPT ALIVE, so it comes back exactly as it was left,
 * archive and all, unless the surface router puts the active board back
 * (`useBoardSurfaceOnNav`). The archive is somewhere you go; it is never
 * somewhere a navigation returns you to.
