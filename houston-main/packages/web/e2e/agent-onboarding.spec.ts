 * chat panel on it beside the board.
 *
 * The user typed nothing, so the mission has NO user bubble: the directive
 * rides the auto-continue marker and the transcript folds it away on both the
 * live and the reload path. What the user sees is the agent speaking first, a
 * board card titled `setupMission.title` ("Getting set up"), and the "Set up"
 * tag on that card.
 *
 * The mission's first message is a hello naming the agent and the job it was
 * hired for, from the record the create writes (`lib/setup-mission-greeting.ts`)
 * — so it is whole in the first paint, it is the same sentence on every run, and
 * it stays at the top of the transcript once the agent itself replies.
