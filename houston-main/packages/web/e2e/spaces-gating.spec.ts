/**
 * C8 Spaces gating (HOU-824 / HOU-878): when the host advertises
 * `capabilities.spaces`, Admin exists in personal and team spaces. A personal
 * space has nobody in it to administer, so Admin drops People,
 * Billing and Activity there (`orgTabIds`). The gate is `canSeeOrganization(caps, activeSpaceIsTeam)`
 * (`app/src/components/organization/org-view-model.ts`), where the active space is
 * a team iff its workspace id is `org:<16-hex>` (`app/src/lib/space-id.ts`).
 *
 * Admin is a top-level screen, so the gate controls its dashboard and its
 * rail row: callers below the gate see neither. It is the only screen this
 * gate draws; agent policy is discovered through each employee's own screen,
 * which carries a gate of its own (`agent-policy.spec.ts`).
 *
 * On a NON-spaces multiplayer host (legacy Teams v2, exactly one org) there is no
 * personal/team split, so the gate falls through to the members-roster rule and
 * Admin stays visible on the sole workspace — the regression guard below.
 *
 * The spaces-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` (`{ spaces:true }`) and `/__test__/workspaces` (team
 * rows the C8 workspaces bridge serves at `GET /v1/workspaces`). See
 * `@houston/fake-host` README + `packages/web/e2e/README.md`.
 *
 * The team-space cases drive the REAL switcher UI against the fake host's
 * armed team rows — live since the adapter's `listWorkspaces` bridges the C8
 * workspaces surface (HOU-881).
