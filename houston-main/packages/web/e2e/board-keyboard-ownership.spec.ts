 * WHO owns the board keyboard while a board is alive but off the glass.
 *
 * The employee screen is a kept-alive top-level screen: once visited it stays
 * mounted, hidden behind `display: none`, with its mission board and all of
 * its state intact. A board claims the arrow-key navigator and the Enter
 * opener by publishing callbacks into the UI store — a single slot, so every
 * registration is last-writer-wins.
 *
 * That makes the claim a correctness rule rather than a detail: only the board
 * actually ON SCREEN may hold it. A hidden board that keeps the slot moves a
 * highlight ring inside its own invisible screen and swallows the key, so the
 * user's arrow does nothing they can see.
