/**
 * Visual-regression baselines for markdown inside chat bubbles (HOU-1051).
 *
 * Only the AGENT renders markdown: the fake host answers with its fixed
 * MARKDOWN_SHOWCASE (triggered by "markdown" in the prompt) — all six heading
 * levels, emphasis, ordered/unordered/nested lists, a blockquote, a table,
 * inline code, a fenced code block, and a link — retuned to the chat type
 * scale in `ui/chat` (h1 20px … h5/h6 14px). The USER bubble pins the other
 * half of HOU-1051: the multi-line markdown typed into the composer renders
 * VERBATIM (`##` and `**` stay literal, line break kept), never as markup.
 * Any drift on either path shows up here first.
 *
 * The viewport is TALLER than the suite's 1280×800 default: the showcase is a
 * full document, and at 800px the chat scroller would crop the user bubble +
 * top headings out of the frame. 1280×1550 fits the entire settled
 * conversation, so every element is pinned in one deterministic shot.
 *
 * Settle rule: the showcase's fixed closing sentence must be on screen before
 * the pixel compare, so no streaming delta or caret is in the frame. Both
 * themes; determinism rules in ../README.md.
