/**
 * Visual-regression baselines for a chat conversation with messages.
 *
 * We open the seeded "Plan a trip to Tokyo" mission, send one follow-up, and
 * wait for the fake host's canned reply to SETTLE ("Roger that. You said: …")
 * before the pixel compare. Capturing only the settled state keeps this
 * deterministic: the streamed deltas and the typing caret are gone, the reply
 * text is a fixed echo of the prompt, and chat bubbles carry no timestamp
 * (verified in ui/chat/src — no relative-time rendering). `caret: "hide"`
 * (config-wide) also removes the composer's blinking text cursor.
 *
 * Both themes; determinism rules in ../README.md.
