/**
 * Visual-regression baselines for the main shell (sidebar + mission board).
 *
 * The board belongs to one AI Employee, with the sidebar, titlebar, and seeded
 * missions. It is fully deterministic under the fake
 * host: two seeded missions with FIXED timestamps (state-store.ts `EPOCH`),
 * and the kanban cards render no relative time (only sort by it), so the whole
 * screen is stable. We capture it in both themes at a fixed desktop viewport,
 * plus one narrow-width run (the most important screen gets responsive
 * coverage).
 *
 * Determinism rules for this suite live in ../README.md. In short: fixed
 * viewport, `animations: "disabled"` (config-wide), a small
 * `maxDiffPixelRatio`. The board screens carry no live clock, so they need no
 * masks; the phone screens (Agents home, the per-agent missions drill) render
 * relative times against the wall clock and mask those spans.
