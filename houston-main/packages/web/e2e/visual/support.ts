/**
 * Shared helpers for the visual-regression suite.
 *
 * The visual specs reuse the same boot seed + per-test host reset as the
 * functional suite (`../support/fixtures`), so every baseline is captured
 * against the fake host's deterministic seed. The only extra knob these specs
 * need is the app THEME.
 *
 * How theme is pinned here — and why it is NOT the `houston.pref.theme`
 * preference: both entries do load that pref (desktop `StartupEffects`, web
 * `useEngineTheme` in app-tree.tsx) — but only ONCE, right after the engine
 * handshake, which lands long before a spec is ready to shoot. Driving a
 * baseline through the pref would mean seeding it before boot and re-navigating
 * per theme; the pin below is a live switch instead. It runs after the shell is
 * visible, i.e. after that one-shot load, so it always wins. The switch the UI
 * actually reads is `data-theme` on `<html>`: the `@theme inline` token bridge in
 * ui/core/src/globals.css re-resolves every color utility from it, live, on the
 * consuming element (see theme-pin.spec.ts). We therefore pin it directly —
 * AFTER navigation (an `addInitScript` at document-start races the parser
 * creating `<html>`), the same way theme-pin.spec.ts flips it via
 * `page.evaluate`. Because the whole app is CSS-token-driven (no JS theme state
 * in the web build), toggling the attribute re-themes the entire tree, and
 * `toHaveScreenshot`'s stability wait absorbs the re-resolve before the shot.
