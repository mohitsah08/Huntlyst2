/**
 * Agent POLICY: who may use an agent, and what the agent itself may reach.
 *
 * It is discovered through the focused agent screen.
 *
 * The page itself is fully agent-centric: seven section lozenges across its
 * drilled header, and the selected section below. There is no
 * top-level People tab and no per-person lens.
 *
 * This proves the whole shape: the team lists its agents, drilling in shows the
 * rail, the team-wide access choice writes the everyone sentinel, a People
 * access change (Can use -> No access) set-replaces the roster via
 * `PUT /v1/agents/:slug/assignments`, and an Apps ceiling narrow persists via
 * `PUT /v1/agents/:slug/settings` — each verified with a full reload so the
 * write reached the gateway, not just the client cache. A plain member gets no
 * "AI Employee settings" lozenge at all, so the whole configure surface is out of reach for
 * them rather than half-shown.
 *
 * The Teams-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` (multiplayer + Teams + a `role`) and `/__test__/org`
 * (a multi-member roster + an agent fleet with per-agent assignments). See
 * `@houston/fake-host` README + `packages/web/e2e/README.md`.
