/**
 * The integrations permissioning information architecture (the IA end-state).
 * Each concept now has exactly one home:
 *  - POLICY (who can use each agent + what each agent may use — org/agent app
 *    and model ceilings) → the ONE canonical agent settings page, reached
 *    through the team that owns the agent ("focused agent screen").
 *    Covered by `agent-policy.spec.ts`; it is NOT the global Integrations page,
 *    which is always the personal catalog now;
 *  - CATALOG + ACCOUNTS (the caller's personal connected apps) → the global
 *    Integrations page, its one surface, visible to EVERY role in every mode (a
 *    plain member keeps its nav). The SHARED SKILLS library is a screen of its
 *    own from its own rail row, behind the space-owner gate
 *    (`settings-ia.spec.ts`, `spaces-gating.spec.ts`). Opening a connected app's
 *    detail modal shows info + reconnect + disconnect ONLY — which agents may
 *    use an app is managed in one place, the agent's own settings page, never
 *    here. Settings > Connected accounts is GONE (no settings row at all; the
 *    sidebar nav is the one way in);
 *
 * The per-agent Integrations TAB is GONE with the agent tab shell: connections
 * are the caller's, not an agent's (Composio platform mode), so the global page
 * is the one catalog, and the agent's app CEILING is the "Integrations" section of its
 * settings page (`agent-policy.spec.ts`).
 *
 * The Teams-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` (advertise `multiplayer` + `teams` + a `role`)
 * control. See `@houston/fake-host` README + `packages/web/e2e/README.md`.
