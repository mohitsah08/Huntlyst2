/**
 * Sending to an agent whose pod is asleep (PRODUCT-1643).
 *
 * On a cloud boot, or after an idle pod scales to zero while the app stays
 * open, EVERY per-agent read is held by the gateway for the whole cold start.
 * The send paths used to await such reads (the mission's pin lookup, the board
 * row's read-modify-write) BEFORE the turn stream could push the user's
 * bubble — so Enter did nothing visible for seconds and the send button read
 * as dead. The fake host's cold-start hold models the gateway: every
 * per-agent GET stalls for the armed window, writes and the turn's POST go
 * through, and the reply's SSE (a GET) lands once the hold lifts — exactly
 * like a pod waking up.
 *
 * The proof in both specs is the timing gap: the bubble must show well inside
 * the hold, and the reply must still arrive after it.
