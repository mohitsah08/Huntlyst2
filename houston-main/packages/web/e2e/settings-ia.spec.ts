/**
 * The rail's information architecture, and what Settings is left holding.
 *
 * Six things must hold, and each of them broke a real user path when it
 * didn't:
 *
 * 1. the rail carries the AI Employees and nothing else, the AI Manager pinned
 *    first; everything else is the workspace menu at its foot — Admin (behind
 *    the org gate), AI Models, Integrations, then Academy and Settings — with
 *    no Skills row and no help control;
 * 2. two retired destinations hold no rail row: agent policy is reached
 *    through each employee's own screen, and **Time worked** has no screen
 *    of its own. Each is asserted absent from the rail by name, so a
 *    top-level row for either fails here;
 * 3. Settings holds the person's standing setup: the general group everybody
 *    sees, plus Danger. The Context editors live in their own surfaces, so
 *    Settings carries no "Help" / "Context" / "Support" / "Workspace" /
 *    "Team" heading;
 * 4. Admin is a top-level screen opened from the workspace menu, so its header strip
 *    carries no way back;
 * 5. the rail's Settings entry ALWAYS lands on the index, including from inside
 *    a section — otherwise it is a dead click, since the view is already
 *    `settings`;
 * 6. Settings is the app's ONE identity control: the index opens on the
 *    signed-in person and carries the only Sign out in the product, so the rail
 *    keeps no avatar menu (edit profile / account settings / send feedback /
 *    sign out) as a second door onto the same page.
