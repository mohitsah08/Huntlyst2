 *
 *  - **About me** — what the agents know about the PERSON. They set it once
 *    about themselves, so it is a SECTION of Settings, beside their name and
 *    their language. It is ungated: it exists in every deployment, including a
 *    solo desktop install.
 *  - **Company context** — what the agents know about the COMPANY. It is
 *    shared by everyone in the space, so it is the space owner's: a pill in
 *    the Admin header opening its editor in a sheet, available to a
 *    multiplayer team owner or admin and in a Spaces personal space. A solo
 *    install has no org read.
 *
 * The underlying data did not move: each half still reads and writes its own
 * slot of the same blob (`WORKSPACE.md` / `USER.md` locally, the org+user blobs
 * in cloud) through `use-workspace-context`.
