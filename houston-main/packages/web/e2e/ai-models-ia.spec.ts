/**
 * The AI-models permissioning information architecture — the model-side twin of
 * `integrations-ia.spec.ts`. Each concept has one home:
 *  - POLICY (the allowed-models ceiling) is PER AGENT only → the agent settings
 *    page's AI models section, reached through the team that owns the agent
 *    ("focused agent screen", the one door). The old workspace-wide
 *    "Defaults for every agent" model ceiling was removed as overengineering.
 *    The AI Models hub has provider and model-directory header lozenges.
 *  - ACCOUNTS (HOU-976) are per PERSON and only per person: a team space has no
 *    shared AI account at all — every agent runs on the AI account of whoever
 *    messages it — so the hub is visible to EVERYONE and shows each viewer their
 *    own accounts, with no role-gated section inside it. The space-wide spend
 *    roll-up did NOT open up with it: it lives in Admin, behind the unchanged owner/admin gate.
 *  - Each member's own model pick lives in the composer, not the hub.
 *  - USAGE (how much of each connected AI account is left) belongs to the
 *    account, so it renders on the hub's Connected row. There is no separate
 *    usage screen anywhere (HOU-789).
 *
 * The Teams-shaped state single-player can't reach is armed via the fake host's
 * `/__test__/capabilities` (advertise `multiplayer` + `teams` + a `role`),
 * `/__test__/workspaces` (the C8 team-space row the hub's account note keys
 * off) and `/__test__/agent-settings` (the agent model ceiling); the `/v1/org`
 * view load is served by the fake host. See `@houston/fake-host` README +
 * `packages/web/e2e/README.md`.
