/**
 * HOU-943 + HOU-960 — a SHARED chat reads like a group chat.
 *
 *  - a TEAMMATE's turn mirrors to the LEFT: their face in a column beside the
 *    bubble, their name as the bubble's FIRST LINE, in their own stable tone;
 *  - the VIEWER's own turn keeps the right-aligned bubble with no face and no
 *    visible name (a group chat never writes your name on your own bubble);
 *  - the AGENT keeps its prose layout, its mark, and its name in its colour;
 *  - name + face print only on the FIRST message of a run from one sender.
 *
 * Single player is untouched: no names, no faces, no left bubbles.
 *
 * The shared shape can't be produced by a local turn (only the cloud gateway
 * stamps a message's `author`), so the transcript is armed on the fake host
 * (`/__test__/chat-history`) alongside multiplayer capabilities — the same
 * wire shape `GET /agents/:id/conversations/:id/history` serves in the cloud.
 * That makes this a real regression test for the whole pipeline: history →
 * `historyToFeed` → the SDK conversation VM → `ui/chat`'s sender presentation.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPEC SIGNS IN (HOU-960). "Is this bubble MINE?" keys off
 * `useSession().uid`; with no identity every row is treated as the viewer's own
 * and nothing mirrors. So the spec runs on the identity-ON server and signs in
 * as {@link E2E_VIEWER}, which is what makes the self/teammate split testable
 * at all.
