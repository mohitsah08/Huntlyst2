/**
 * An employee's skill EDITOR: one skill, read two ways.
 *
 * A row of the employee's Skills section opens the skill IN PLACE of the list
 * (no modal), and the
 * editor's header carries the Workflow / Text switch — the one control that
 * decides whether a non-technical owner reads their skill as numbered steps or
 * as the markdown behind them. A skill written as plain instructions has no
 * parsed workflow, so its Workflow view says so and offers the way across
 * rather than showing an empty panel; the Text view is always the real
 * SKILL.md in an editable field.
 *
 * The editor's own back arrow (under the tab cluster, not a browser step) is
 * what returns the list, because the editor replaced it.
