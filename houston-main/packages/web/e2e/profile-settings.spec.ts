/**
 * A user names themselves, and Houston believes them everywhere.
 *
 * Settings > Profile writes the caller's own display name and picture through
 * the gateway's `PUT /v1/me/profile`. The point of the feature is NOT the form:
 * it is that the saved identity is the one every multiplayer surface renders,
 * so this spec proves the write reaches the host and then lands on a surface
 * that is not the editor itself.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPEC SIGNS IN. `useMyEditableProfile` is gated on
 * `isIdentityConfigured() && a live session`, and the self-face it repaints
 * (`useMyProfile` -> `GET /v1/org/profiles` for `useSession().uid`) needs a real
 * uid. The default e2e server bakes no Firebase key, so the section cannot even
 * render there. Like chat-senders.spec.ts, this runs on the identity-ON server
 * and signs in as {@link E2E_VIEWER}.
 *
 * The fake host models the whole contract (`routes-me.ts`): a `PUT` stores the
 * override, resolves the effective value, and REFLECTS it onto the armed org
 * roster, so `GET /v1/org/people` and `GET /v1/org/profiles` immediately serve
 * the new name/photo — exactly what the cloud gateway does, and what makes the
 * sidebar face repaint without a reload.
