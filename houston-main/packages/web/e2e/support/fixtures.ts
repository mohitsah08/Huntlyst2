/**
 * Shared Playwright fixtures.
 *
 * Every test gets a page that is (a) reset to the fake host's seed and (b) primed
 * with the boot seed, so specs start from a known shell with one connected agent.
 *
 * Each parallel WORKER runs its own in-process fake host: `FAKE_HOST_PORT` is
 * worker-slot-aware (see `@houston/fake-host` config.ts), and workers are
 * separate OS processes, so their in-memory host state is isolated for free.
 * That is what lets the suite run fully parallel; within a worker, state is
 * still reset per test.
