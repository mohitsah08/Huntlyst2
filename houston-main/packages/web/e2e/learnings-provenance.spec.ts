 * Memory (learnings) provenance — HOU-946.
 *
 * Every learning links back to the person who taught it and the mission it came
 * from, and that link has to be VISIBLE wherever learnings are shown. The fake
 * host seeds two: one stamped with both halves, one with neither.
 *
 * The default e2e project is single-player with identity off, so no roster
 * resolves — which is exactly the desktop case. The line must still read, from
 * the name stored on the learning itself. And the learning WITHOUT provenance
 * must render no line at all rather than a hollow "From unknown".
