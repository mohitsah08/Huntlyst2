/**
 * The producer half of the `Retry-After` contract.
 *
 * `lib/assistant-availability.ts` has always scheduled discovery's retry off
 * `err.retryAfterMs` — the server's own estimate of when its pod will be ready
 * beats any client-side curve. This is where that field comes from: every
 * gateway/host failure thrown by `cpFetch` carries the response's parsed
 * `Retry-After`, or nothing at all when there is no trustworthy hint.
 *
 * 429 is used throughout because it is NOT one of the transient statuses
 * `cpFetch` retries, so each case throws on the first attempt.
