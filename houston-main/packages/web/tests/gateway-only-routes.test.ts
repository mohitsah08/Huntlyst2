/**
 * The gateway-only list is a claim about another repository: that the hosted
 * gateway serves each of these routes and `packages/host` never will. A line
 * for a route nobody serves would send an SDK wave to build against a route
 * that is not there — so every line is checked against the gateway's own route
 * export.
 *
 * That export is vendored into this repo (`scripts/sdk-parity/`) and read
 * through the same resolver the SDK parity gate uses, so the claim is checked
 * on every run — including CI, which holds no checkout of the private cloud
 * repo. The vendored copy is read on its own: a developer's `cloud` checkout,
 * wherever it sits and whatever branch it is on, has no say in this suite.
