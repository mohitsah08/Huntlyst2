 * before they go out. Settling has two triggers — the dispatched turn's own
 * flush call, and the store watcher that fires when the VM's `running` flips
 * false (observer settles, the stale-running heal). Auto-resume sends (a
 * provider-reconnect continue) are deduped and dropped when redundant. The
 * adapter's module-scoped VM is shared across tests, so each case uses its own
 * conversation key.
