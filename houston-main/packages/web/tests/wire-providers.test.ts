/**
 * The WORKSPACE-CENTRAL credential writes — connect-once capture, the desktop's
 * Claude push, sign-out, the pasted API key and the OpenAI-compatible server,
 * each in its per-agent and its agentless (`/setup-runtime`) spelling — ride
 * `sdk.providers.credentials`.
 *
 * What these pin is the wire, because the routes are the host's connect-once
 * surface and the SDK also carries a RUNTIME provider surface
 * (`sdk.providers.writes`, `/agents/:id/auth/…`) that looks like it would do.
 * It would not: a write there touches one pod's `auth.json` and leaves the
 * central store — which every agent in the space serves from — untouched, so
 * the next turn re-hydrates the agent and undoes it. Sending the same bytes as
 * before is therefore the whole contract, and each assertion below states them
 * whole: the URL, the method, the body, and the three headers the gateway
 * routes on.
 *
 * SECRETS: every one of these calls carries a pasted key or a minted OAuth
 * credential, and each test asserts it appears in the BODY and nowhere in the
 * URL — the path carries only ids, so nothing reaches a log line that records
 * a request path. `credential-write-urls.test.ts` holds the matching rule that
 * no scope ever re-enters the URL.
