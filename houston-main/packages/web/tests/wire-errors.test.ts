/**
 * Every delegated SDK call wears `cpFetch`'s two observable behaviors, because
 * every one of them goes through `viaSdk` (`client/sdk-error.ts`).
 *
 * Both are invisible in the happy path and both were regressions the moment a
 * mixin called `this.ctx.sdk.*` directly:
 *
 *  - the SDK's own errors (`AgentsHttpError`, `EngineError`) are not
 *    `HoustonEngineError`, so `isSignedOutEngineError` read false and the app's
 *    error-toast layer red-toasted a plain sign-out and filed it to Sentry
 *    (`app/src/lib/error-toast.ts`);
 *  - a per-agent success no longer ended that agent's stuck-wake episode
 *    (PRODUCT-1640), so an agent that had been answering "waking" kept its
 *    episode open across calls the pod had plainly answered.
