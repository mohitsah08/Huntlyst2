/**
 * End-to-end guard for the AI Models page against the fake host: the app's
 * `getCatalog()` must reach `GET /v1/catalog`, and hydrating from it must yield
 * a NON-EMPTY provider + model set.
 *
 * Regression: the fake host had no `/v1/catalog` route, so `getCatalog()`
 * 404-degraded to `[]`, `hydrateProviderCatalog` kept the override-only seed
 * (all providers, ZERO models), and the AI Models page showed ~10 providers /
 * 0 models. This drives the REAL client against the REAL fake-host route so the
 * whole path (fetch → parse → hydrate → visibility) can't silently empty again.
