 * the assistant catalog publishes out of `boot-mixin.ts`.
 *
 * It moved off the hand-rolled `gatewayAuthFetch` block onto `cpFetch`, which
 * is what makes the generator see a route at all. So what is pinned here is
 * that the move changed nothing a caller can observe — the same single GET with
 * the same auth and active-space headers, the same `HoustonEngineError` on a
 * non-2xx — plus the degrade `deploymentServes` builds on top of it, which is
 * the only caller that must survive the probe failing.
