/**
 * Playwright drives the FULL desktop UI (app/src) as it runs in the browser
 * (packages/web), on the host adapter in host mode, against an
 * in-memory fake host (@houston/fake-host) — no real backend, no AI provider.
 *
 * The suite runs FULLY PARALLEL: every Playwright worker starts its own
 * in-process fake host on a worker-slot port (see support/fixtures.ts and
 * `@houston/fake-host` config.ts), so workers never share host state. The
 * `webServer` fake host below serves only the main process (global-setup's
 * warm-up); vite is shared by all workers, which is fine once warm.
