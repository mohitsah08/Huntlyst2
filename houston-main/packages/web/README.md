# Houston Web (`packages/web`)

Standalone browser build of the Houston desktop UI. It composes `app/src`
verbatim and swaps Tauri/OS imports for browser shims at build time.

The backend is the Houston host (`packages/host`) over protocol v3, the only
engine. Which root mounts depends on the deployment, not on the engine.

## Modes

- **Cloud host mode**: `VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` is set. Domain calls go to the
  host through `@houston/engine-adapter`, the app's own GCIP (Firebase) auth
  gates sign-in, and `/admin` mounts the operator dashboard.
- **Self-host mode**: no control-plane URL. The host URL + token come from a
  stored config, from `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN`, or from
  the Connect screen at runtime.

## Running in dev

Run `pnpm dev` from the repo root — the ONE entry point. Its `web` pane serves
this package on http://localhost:1430 against the local Go gateway (cloud
profile: real sign-in, multiplayer).
Do not run this package's `dev` script directly; outside the pane's env it
boots a differently-configured app, which is the drift `pnpm dev` exists to
prevent.

## How It Works

```
src/
  main.tsx          chooses cloud-host / self-host root from env
  cloud-login.tsx   host-mode auth wrapper
  app-tree.tsx      app/src providers + gates + <App />
  new-engine/       external-host connect screen + app wrapper
  shims/            @tauri-apps/* browser equivalents
  admin/            cloud operator dashboard mounted at /admin
```

Host mode covers workspaces, agents, chat, board, skills, routines, files,
providers, preferences, attachments, portable agents, integrations, the Agent
Store, and global `/v1/events` reactivity.

The Agent Store is fully wired here, not stubbed:

- **Browse** — `@houston/engine-adapter` (`src/store-catalog.ts`). Anonymous,
  CORS-open catalog reads against the store gateway, so browsing works
  signed-out.
- **Install** — `@houston/engine-adapter` (`src/portable-from-store.ts`).
  Prefers the host's `/v1/portable/fetch-from-store`; hosted deployments have no
  local host (the cloud gateway answers 501 for `/v1/portable*`), so the browser
  falls back to reading the public IR off the store gateway and converting it
  with the same shared code the host route runs. Either path parks the package
  in the registry a file upload uses, so the wizard steps downstream are
  identical.
- **Publish** — `@houston/engine-adapter` (`src/portable-store.ts` +
  `src/store-gateway.ts`). Posts the agent IR to the gateway `/v1/agentstore`
  API with the user's own session bearer (no manage tokens), reusing the engine
  transport's 401-refresh discipline.

## Optional Env

- `VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` / `VITE_CP_DEV_TOKEN` — host-mode endpoint + dev token.
- `VITE_NEW_ENGINE` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN` — external
  new-engine mode.
- `VITE_AGENTSTORE_GATEWAY_URL` — store gateway for the public catalog reads.
  There is no production fallback: a build without it has no store, loudly.
- `VITE_AGENTSTORE_SITE_URL` — public store site for "browse the store" links
  (defaults to the production site).
- `POSTHOG_KEY` / `POSTHOG_HOST` — analytics.
- `SENTRY_DSN` — error reporting.

Auth storage mode is forced to `browser`; a browser tab has no OS keychain.

## Browser Equivalents And Limits

Browser shims implement external-link open, desktop notifications, and portable
agent import/export via Blob download and file input.

Desktop-only actions surface a clear error if triggered: reveal in Finder, open
file or terminal, pick local directory, native app update, and local log files.

`Report Bug` works in cloud host mode by posting the desktop payload to the
host's `POST /feedback` route, which files Linear server-side. Outside cloud host
mode it stays desktop-only.

## Installable (PWA)

The web app installs to a phone or desktop home screen with the Houston icon:
`public/manifest.webmanifest` (name, standalone display, 192/512 `any` +
`maskable` icons) plus the `apple-touch-icon` / `apple-mobile-web-app-*` head
tags in `index.html`, which are what iOS Safari's "Add to Home Screen" reads.
The icons are renders of the opaque app icon in the Tauri icon set
(`app/src-tauri/icons/ios/AppIcon-512@2x.png`); regenerate them from that file
if the brand mark changes. There is deliberately no service worker: the bundle
is served `no-cache` so every launch runs the current release, and an offline
cache would only serve stale chunks against a live host. `tests/pwa-manifest.test.ts`
pins the contract.

## Parity Guard

`scripts/check-desktop-native.mjs` runs during `typecheck` and `build`, and from
the root `pnpm check`. It fails if `app/src` imports a new Tauri module or
invokes a native command this package has not shimmed, and it holds the rest of
the native boundary too (see `app/src/lib/desktop-native-commands.ts`).

## Relationship To Other Frontends

- `app/` — Tauri desktop app, same React tree plus native shell.
- `packages/web` — same UI in a browser tab, backed by the host.
