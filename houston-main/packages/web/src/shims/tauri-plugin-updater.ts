 * Web shim for `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`.
 *
 * There is no self-managed app bundle to update in a browser tab (the page is

 * staying idle — so no update surface ever shows on web, with no errors logged.
 *
 * The `Update` shape mirrors the members the machine reads, so the
 * (dead-on-web) download and install paths still type-check against this shim.
