/**
 * Web entry point. The Houston host is the only engine — the full desktop UI
 * (app/src) always runs against it (vite.config aliases
 * `@houston/engine-adapter` to the host adapter). Which root mounts depends
 * only on the deployment:
 *
 *  - **Cloud host** (`VITE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`): the app's own GCIP (Firebase)
 *    auth gates sign-in (plus the `/admin` operator dashboard on that path).
 *  - **Default**: `<NewEngineRoot>` — the host URL + token come from a stored
 *    config, are pre-seeded via `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_URL` / `VITE_NEW_ENGINE_TOKEN`,
 *    or are entered at runtime on the Connect screen.
