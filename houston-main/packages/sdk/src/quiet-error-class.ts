 * The quiet failure classes of every client's error-surfacing layer, and the

 * state the SDK names in `local-model-bridge/quiet`) that the person sees as
 * ONE informational notice, never a bug report, while the raw diagnostic still
 * reaches Sentry as a warning under a FIXED fingerprint per class
 * (PRODUCT-1640): each class is one issue with a count and searchable bodies,
 * and a deploy roll can never file new issues.
 *
 * The classifiers that NAME a class read transport and gateway shapes, so they
 * live in the engine adapter and the app; this module holds only the vocabulary
 * and the collapse rule they share, so every surface (desktop, web) reports one
 * episode the same way. Dependency-free and erasable-syntax-only: the app's
 * node:test entry points load this module through the
 * `@houston/sdk/quiet-error-class` subpath, so the one import below is a
 * package self-reference (node resolves no extensionless relative import).
