/**
 * The account REST calls — the caller's own display profile and personal API
 * keys — over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * These are gateway-only routes (`/v1/me/profile`, `/v1/keys`): the runtime
 * client is scoped to one agent's sandbox and serves none of them, so the
 * module talks to them through {@link httpRequest} with literal paths, which is
 * also what keeps them visible to the assistant's operation catalog.
 *
 * Nothing is swallowed here: a non-2xx always throws an
 * {@link AccountHttpError} carrying the HTTP `status`, so a `404` from a
 * gateway that predates `/v1/me/profile` reaches the caller and it — not this
 * layer — decides whether that hides a section or is a failure. The `key_limit`
 * 400 of a 20th API key likewise arrives intact for its inline treatment. A
 * `401` additionally fires {@link HttpScope.onUnauthorized}, so a lapsed
 * session token becomes a visible `tokenExpired` signal.
