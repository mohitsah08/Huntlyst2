/**
 * The persisted-history → feed fold: turn a conversation's `ChatMessage[]`

 *
 * THE one implementation of that fold. The SDK uses it to seed a conversation's
 * reactive VM (the `turns/history` read and the `observe` hydration seam), and
 * the web engine-adapter delegates to it (`engine-adapter/translate.ts`) with
 * its OWN provider-id remap — so a wire change to what history carries lands in
 * exactly one place. The provider id is carried through untouched by default
 * (the SDK is provider-id-agnostic); a caller that renders old frontend ids
 * passes a `mapProvider`.
