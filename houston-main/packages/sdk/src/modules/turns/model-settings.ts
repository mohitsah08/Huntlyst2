 * that belongs to a DIFFERENT provider than the one it runs, so a bare
 * `{ model }` pin silently mis-runs (or throws). When a model is given, find
 * its owning provider from the live providers listing and pin BOTH.
 *
 * A model the listing doesn't own (unreachable engine, a dynamic id) passes
 * through as `{ model }` alone — the runtime applies its own default/migration;
 * this never throws (the pick is best-effort, never a hard turn failure here).
 * Effort-only picks (no model) skip the listing entirely.
