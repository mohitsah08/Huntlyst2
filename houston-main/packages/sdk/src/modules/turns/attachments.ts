 * Composer attachments — files the user drops on a chat message, uploaded INTO
 * the agent's workspace so the runtime's clamped Read tool can open them during
 * the turn. The write half of the attachment story; the marker that names the
 * saved paths in the turn's text lives in `attachment-text.ts`.
 *
 * The REQUEST itself belongs to the files module (`files/uploads.ts`): one wire
 * body, one owner, so the `relPath` that keeps a dropped folder's nesting
 * reaches the host from the dispatch path exactly as it does from the Files
 * section. The turn adds the untrusted-envelope guard for the dispatch command
 * and the typed too-large error a composer renders.
