 * subscription is RESUMABLE: a dropped or idle connection silently reconnects
 * with `?after=<last seq>` and replays the gap, so a transport close never
 * settles the turn. The turn settles ONLY on a terminal frame for OUR turn, on
 * a sync/frame that proves our turn ended while we were away (then from
 * persisted history, by turnId), on a rejected send, on a fatal (401/403/404/
 * 410) stream refusal, or after `STREAM_FAILURE_BUDGET` dead reconnects —
 * never from partial text on a silent close.
 *
 * A send that fails at the TRANSPORT level (fetch threw — no engine verdict)
 * is AMBIGUOUS: the engine may have accepted the message and be running the
 * turn with only the 202 lost to the dropped connection. Failing the turn
 * immediately would render an error card against a live turn whose reply then
 * lands anyway (HOU-683). So the ambiguous path settles nothing: the already-
 * open subscription arbitrates — our nonce echo or a running sync proves the
 * turn started (it then renders and settles normally); if no evidence arrives
 * within `tuning.sendVerdictMs`, the send provably never landed and the turn
 * fails with `SEND_LOST_MESSAGE`. A definitive rejection (the engine answered:
 * EngineError) or the caller's own abort still fails immediately.
 *
 * When a live observer holds the conversation, the send goes FIRST and the
 * observer keeps rendering until it is accepted: a 202 disposes the observer
 * and the turn stream resumes from the observer's cursor (so no frame — our
 * `user` echo included — is lost); a rejected send (e.g. the cloud's one-turn
 * gate answering 409 while the observed turn runs) leaves the observer
 * rendering and surfaces the refusal as a system message WITHOUT settling the
 * conversation as an error — a turn is demonstrably running and its card must
 * stay running.
 *
 * `registry` is the caller's stream set (one per SDK / adapter) — passed
 * explicitly so two owners never share a map and cross-abort each other.
