 * the full text so far), so it updates a SINGLE feed entry in place; its final
 * flush (`assistant_text`) finalizes the same entry — a turn's reply is one
 * bubble, never a streamed-then-duplicated pair.
 *
 * `boardStatus` mirrors exactly what a host's bus consumer sees through the
 * `persistBoardStatus` seam, because it is the ONLY signal that tells a handled
 * settle apart from a real failure: a user Stop (and a logged-out provider)
 * settles `sessionStatus === "error"` but `boardStatus === "needs_you"`, so a
 * surface keying off `sessionStatus` alone would render a normal Stop red. Read
 * the pair: `boardStatus` `needs_you` = handled / your attention (every clean
 * finish included — a turn ending never closes a mission), `error` = a genuine
 * failure. `sessionStatus` semantics are unchanged, for web parity.
