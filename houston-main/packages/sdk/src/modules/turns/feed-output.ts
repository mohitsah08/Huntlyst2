 * SessionStatus, and a persisted board-card status. Historically those pushes
 * went straight onto the desktop's in-process event bus. That coupling is now
 * inverted — the machinery emits ONLY through {@link FeedOutput}, and the host
 * supplies the implementation: the SDK's built-in conversation-VM fold
 * (`vm-output.ts`), the web adapter's bus bridge, or several at once
 * ({@link MultiplexFeedOutput}). One machinery, any number of outputs.
 *
 * These three methods mirror the original bus seams exactly; the union types
 * are the same ones the desktop UI reacts to, carried along unchanged.
