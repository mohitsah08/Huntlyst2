 *
 * This is the SDK-path counterpart to the web engine-adapter's bus output
 * (`engine-adapter/feed-output.ts`), which the desktop attaches; the SDK ships
 * it as a DEFAULT output so a binder that never calls `addOutput` still writes
 * the card. The persist runs both fire-and-forget (turn start) and awaited
 * (turn settle); a failure is surfaced to the logger and swallowed here so a
 * dropped board write never rejects the settle or leaks an unhandled rejection.
