/**
 * Passively observe a conversation this client did not (or no longer does)
 * stream — the reload-mid-turn fix. Opened when a chat's history loads: if the
 * server's `sync` reports a turn in flight, surface it (running indicator +
 * partial text) and render live frames to completion, settling exactly like a
 * turn we sent; if the conversation is idle, the stream closes immediately.
 * No-op when the conversation is already streamed (live turn or observer).
 *
 * Failure posture: a fatal stream refusal (401/403/404/410) or an exhausted
 * reconnect budget disposes SILENTLY while nothing is mid-render — a passive
 * background attach has nothing user-initiated to surface — but settles the
 * observed card visibly when a turn was already on screen (it must never
 * freeze). A throwing frame handler is a bug and surfaces as a system message.
