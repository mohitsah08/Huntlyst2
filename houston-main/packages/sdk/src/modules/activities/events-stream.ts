/**
 * The activities reactivity subscription: a long-lived SSE read of the host's
 * `GET /v1/events`, built on the shared `streamGlobalEvents` loop
 * (`@houston/runtime-client`) — the SAME one client-side loop the agents module
 * and the web adapter consume. This module keeps only its own seams: header auth
 * via the injected `fetch`, the clock-driven reconnect wait, and `ActivityChanged`
 * translation (carrying the frame's `agentPath` so the module refetches just
 * that agent).
 *
 * TWO subscriptions per SDK, by design. The agents module opens its own
 * `/v1/events` read for `AgentsChanged`; this one reads `ActivityChanged`.
 * Sharing ONE read would mean folding both filters into a kernel-owned
 * fan-out and refactoring the agents module — out of scope here. The costly
 * piece (the reconnect/read loop) is REUSED via `streamGlobalEvents`; only a
 * second cheap SSE connection is added, mirroring how the web adapter already
 * runs its `subscribeEvents` read alongside the SDK's.
 *
 * On EVERY (re)connect the caller refetches ({@link onConnect}), so events
 * missed while the stream was down are caught up by the reload.
