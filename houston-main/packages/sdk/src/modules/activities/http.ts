/**
 * The per-agent activities REST calls, over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * The runtime client (`@houston/runtime-client`) is scoped to one conversation
 * and serves no typed `.houston` surface, so this module talks to the HOST's
 * `/agents/:id/activities` routes directly through `ports.fetch` — the SAME
 * routes `engine-adapter/control-plane.ts` uses. Auth rides the injected
 * `fetch` (the host wires a bearer-attaching `fetch`), exactly as the agents
 * module does.
 *
 * Errors never get swallowed: a non-2xx throws an {@link ActivitiesHttpError}
 * carrying the HTTP `status`, which `CommandRegistry.dispatch` surfaces as an
 * `ok: false` result. A `401` additionally fires {@link onUnauthorized} so a
 * lapsed session token becomes a visible `tokenExpired` signal.
 *
 * Assistant catalog: the `@assistant` blocks below are the single source of
 * truth for the board operations they sit on. The board's other two
 * declarations live with the calls they describe — the rename in
 * `./mission-rename.ts` and the search in `../missions-search/index.ts` — so a
 * board operation is annotated once, where it is written.
