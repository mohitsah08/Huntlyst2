/**
 * Conversation-LIST module.
 *
 * Owns one reactive scope per agent, `conversations/<agentId>`, holding a
 * {@link ConversationListVM} — the agent's list of conversations. Writes
 * (rename/delete) refetch the list so the snapshot always reflects the engine.
 *
 * SEAM — history/feed is NOT here. Message transcripts and the derived feed
 * (`getHistory` + `streamEvents`) are owned by the turns/feed module. This
 * module never touches history; it is the LIST only. Keep it that way.
 *
 * SEAM — `listConversations` is spelled twice, for two different things. The
 * engine adapter's method of that name
 * (`packages/engine-adapter/src/client/activities-mixin.ts`) builds the
 * BOARD out of an agent's missions; this module's `list` is the agent's chats,
 * off the runtime. Neither calls the other.
 *
 * SEAM — per-agent client. Protocol v3 nests conversations under agents
 * (`/v1/agents/:id/conversations/*`), while `@houston/runtime-client` speaks the
 * flat runtime shape. The kernel resolves the per-agent client (rooted at
 * `${baseUrl}/agents/<id>`) through {@link ModuleContext.clientFor} — one
 * memoized cache shared with the turns module — so this module never constructs
 * a client itself.
