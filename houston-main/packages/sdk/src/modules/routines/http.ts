/**
 * The routine-DEFINITION REST calls — what an agent repeats, and when — over
 * the injected `fetch`. The runs themselves (firing one now, stopping one under
 * way, the incoming-webhook key an outside service starts one with) live in
 * `runs.ts`, so each file is one lifecycle; both hang off the same `/agents/:id`
 * prefix.
 *
 * These are agent-proxy routes: the gateway forwards them to that agent's pod.
 * They go through {@link httpRequest} with literal paths rather than the runtime
 * client, which is what keeps them visible to the assistant's operation catalog.
 *
 * Nothing is swallowed here: a non-2xx always throws a {@link RoutinesHttpError}
 * carrying the HTTP `status`, so the caller — never this layer — decides whether
 * a `404` hides a surface or is a failure. A `401` additionally fires
 * {@link HttpScope.onUnauthorized}, so a lapsed session token becomes a visible
 * `tokenExpired` signal.
