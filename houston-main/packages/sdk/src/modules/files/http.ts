/**
 * The workspace-file REST calls — listing, reading, and rearranging what lives
 * in an agent's real workspace — over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * The runtime client (`@houston/runtime-client`) is scoped to one conversation
 * and serves none of the `/agents/:id/files*` family, so this module talks to
 * those host routes through {@link httpRequest} with literal paths, which is
 * also what keeps them visible to the assistant's operation catalog.
 *
 * Nothing is swallowed here: a non-2xx always throws a {@link FilesHttpError}
 * carrying the HTTP `status`, so a deployment with no workspace to serve (the
 * synthetic local web build) reaches the caller and it — not this layer —
 * decides whether that is an empty Files section or a failure. A `401`
 * additionally fires {@link HttpScope.onUnauthorized}, so a lapsed session token
 * becomes a visible `tokenExpired` signal.
 *
 * The two BINARY reads (a file's bytes, the workspace zip) stay with the
 * surface that renders them: both answer a `Blob`, which a JSON envelope cannot
 * carry, so there is nothing for this module to hold.
