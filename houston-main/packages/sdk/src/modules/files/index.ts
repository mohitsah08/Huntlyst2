/**
 * The files module — an agent's REAL workspace: what is in it, what one file
 * says, and every rearrangement of it, plus the two upload routes that put new
 * bytes there.
 *
 * These are pure commands: the Files section opens them, reads once, and writes
 * from a menu; no host event invalidates the listing and nothing renders it
 * continuously, so there is no reactive scope to publish. The same handlers
 * back both the typed facade and the `dispatch` path.
 *
 * SEAM — per-agent, but NOT through `clientFor(agentId)`. The runtime client is
 * scoped to one conversation and serves none of the `/agents/:id/files*`
 * family, so the module talks to those host routes through the SDK's own HTTP
 * seam. A 401 routes through the shared {@link ModuleContext.authExpiry}
 * notifier, which that seam signals.
 *
 * Degradations are the CALLER's: every request here throws on a non-2xx, so a
 * deployment with no workspace to serve says so and the surface — not this
 * layer — decides whether that reads as an empty Files section or a failure.
