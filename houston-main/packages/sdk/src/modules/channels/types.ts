/**
 * Wire types + command vocabulary for the channels module — the messaging
 * accounts a person connects to their personal assistant, in the space they
 * are working in.
 *
 * Everything here is plain JSON, so it crosses the `dispatch` boundary
 * unchanged. There is no reactive scope: the listing is read when the Channels
 * screen opens and every other call is a button's one-shot, so the module is
 * plain-async and publishes nothing (the billing module's shape).
 *
 * The app-facing copy of these shapes, with the guards that parse a gateway
 * answer before a surface renders it, is `@houston/wire-types`. This package
 * does not depend on it, so the shapes are declared here too and the two are
 * kept in step by hand, exactly like `BillingSummary`.
