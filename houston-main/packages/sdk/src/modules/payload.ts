/**
 * Reading an untrusted command payload.

 * here so a refusal reads the same wherever it comes from: one message shape,
 * which is what a caller matches on.
 *
 * These THROW rather than returning a default — `CommandRegistry.dispatch`
 * turns the throw into `ok: false` with the message, and a coerced default
 * would silently act on a field the caller never sent.
