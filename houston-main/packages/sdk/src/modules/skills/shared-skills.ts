/**
 * WORKSPACE-scoped shared skills (`/v1/workspaces/:id/shared-skills`): the
 * library every agent in a space can draw from, including promotion of an
 * agent's own skill into it. Per-agent skills are `sdk.skills.agent`.
 *
 * SEAM — workspace-scoped, NOT per-agent: the runtime client is rooted at one
 * agent's sandbox and serves none of these, so they ride {@link httpRequest} on
 * literal paths, the only spelling the assistant's operation catalog can see.
 * `workspaceId` is the id the SERVER answers to; the synthetic "default"
 * personal id the web UI holds is translated before it reaches here.
 *
 * Degradations are the CALLER's: every request throws on a non-2xx, 404
 * included, so a surface that wants "no library yet" says so itself and no
 * surface is handed a silent empty answer it did not ask for.
