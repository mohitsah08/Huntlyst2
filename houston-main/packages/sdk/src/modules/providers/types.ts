/**
 * Wire + view-model types for the providers module — the per-agent AI-provider
 * connect/status surface. Provider credentials are per-agent-pod in hosted
 * mode, so every scope, command, and call is keyed by `agentId` and routed
 * through `ctx.clientFor(agentId)` (`/agents/<id>/…`).
 *
 * The `providers/<agentId>` snapshot merges the runtime's two provider reads
 * coherently: `GET /providers` (the rich list — models + active model +
 * availability) is the base, and `GET /auth/status` overlays the credential
 * truth (`configured`), the in-flight `login` state, the Copilot Enterprise
 * `enterpriseUrl`, and the runtime's `activeProvider`. Everything here is plain
 * JSON — it crosses the `getSnapshot`/`subscribe`/`dispatch` boundary unchanged.
 *
 * Fields are exactly what the wire provides (`@houston/protocol` via
 * `@houston/runtime-client`); nothing is invented.
