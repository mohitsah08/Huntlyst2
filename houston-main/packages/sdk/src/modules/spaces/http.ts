 * visible to the assistant's operation catalog.

 * carrying the HTTP `status`, and a surface that wants a softer answer (the web
 * switcher's empty list on a gateway that predates spaces) decides that for
 * itself on the status. A `401` additionally fires `onUnauthorized`, so a
 * lapsed session token becomes a visible `tokenExpired` signal.
