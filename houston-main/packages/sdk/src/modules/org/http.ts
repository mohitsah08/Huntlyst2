/**
 * The space-administration REST calls — the roster, the invitations, and the
 * roles — over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * These are gateway-only routes (`/v1/org*`): the runtime client is scoped to
 * one agent's sandbox and serves none of them, so the module talks to them
 * through {@link httpRequest} with literal paths, which is also what keeps them
 * visible to the assistant's operation catalog.
 *
 * Nothing is swallowed here: a non-2xx always throws an {@link OrgHttpError}
 * carrying the HTTP `status`, so the `404` of a gateway that predates a route
 * reaches the caller and it — not this layer — decides whether that hides a
 * surface or is a failure. A `401` additionally fires
 * {@link HttpScope.onUnauthorized}, so a lapsed session token becomes a visible
 * `tokenExpired` signal.
