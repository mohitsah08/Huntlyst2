/**
 * The workspaces family's REST calls, over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * Four capabilities share this module because they share one addressee — the
 * space the user is in: the list of spaces, the raw `.houston/**` docs of an
 * agent inside one, the background notes spliced into every conversation, and
 * the person's sidebar folder arrangement.
 *
 * The runtime client is scoped to ONE conversation and exposes none of them, so
 * this module talks to the host routes directly through `ports.fetch` — auth
 * rides that fetch, exactly as the kernel constructs the runtime client without
 * a token. A non-2xx throws the {@link WorkspacesHttpError} the scope mints; a
 * `401` additionally fires `onUnauthorized`, so a lapsed session becomes a
 * visible `tokenExpired` signal.
