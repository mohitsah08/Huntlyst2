/**
 * The agent-list REST calls, over the injected `fetch`.
 *
 * The runtime client (`@houston/runtime-client`) is scoped to ONE conversation
 * and exposes no agent-list surface, so this module talks to the host's
 * `/agents` routes directly through `ports.fetch` — the same routes
 * `control-plane.ts` uses. Auth rides the injected `fetch` (the host wires a
 * `fetch` that attaches the bearer), exactly as the kernel constructs the
 * runtime client without a token.
 *
 * Errors never get swallowed: a non-2xx throws an {@link AgentsHttpError}
 * carrying the HTTP `status`, which `CommandRegistry.dispatch` surfaces as an
 * `ok: false` result. A `401` additionally fires {@link onUnauthorized} so a
 * lapsed session token becomes a visible `tokenExpired` signal.
 *
 * Assistant catalog: these four functions are its single source of truth for
 * the `/agents` routes, so each carries its own `@assistant` block and the
 * generator reads the route straight off the call it makes here.
