/**
 * The user-scoped custom-integration routes (`/v1/integrations/custom/*`): the
 * outside apps a user adds themselves from a link — their own API or MCP
 * servers. The Composio-backed catalog of connectable providers is a different
 * family; see `reads.ts`.
 *
 * A non-2xx always throws (`modules/http.ts`), including the 404 a deployment
 * without this surface answers the definitions read with. Whether that 404 is
 * "feature absent" or a real failure is the CALLER's judgement (the web adapter
 * degrades it to an empty section), so it is decided at the surface, never
 * swallowed here.
 *
 * Assistant catalog: this file is the single source of truth for these eight
 * operations, so each carries its own `@assistant` block.
