/**
 * `@houston/sdk` — the single headless Houston client.
 *
 * One client implementation under every surface (web, desktop). Reads flow as
 * scope snapshots; writes flow as commands. See README.md for the model.
 *
 * This barrel is the package's public API: the kernel (`HoustonSdk`, the store,
 * the command registry), the shared auth surface, and each module's CONTRACT —
 * its view-model types, scope helpers, and command constants that a consumer
 * subscribes to and dispatches. The `create<Name>Module` factories are internal
 * (the kernel composes them); a host uses `new HoustonSdk(...)`, not a factory.
