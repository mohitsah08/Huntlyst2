/**
 * The shared 401 → `session/tokenExpired` notifier.
 *
 * When an engine request fails with HTTP 401 the host must be told to refresh
 * the token. That signal is the SDK event `session/tokenExpired`. It must fire
 * **exactly once per token value**: a reconnect storm on a stale token (the
 * agents `/v1/events` loop retries every 1.5s) would otherwise spam the host
 * into a refresh loop, yet a 401 on a *newly* set token must fire again.
 *
 * The dedupe keys on **the token the failing request actually carried**, not on
 * whatever token happens to be current when the 401 lands. That distinction is
 * load-bearing: the host proactively refreshes, so `setToken(B)` can run while
 * requests stamped with the old token A are still in flight. Attributing A's
 * late 401 to the fresh token B would re-refresh a perfectly good token — the
 * exact storm this module exists to prevent. The token identity is threaded in
 * by {@link createAuthFetch} (`modules/session/auth-fetch.ts`), the one place
 * that knows which token it stamped on each request; it reports 401s here via
 * {@link AuthExpiryNotifier.notifyExpired}.
 *
 * The kernel owns a single instance and threads it via {@link ModuleContext}, so
 * every module shares one dedupe. {@link AuthExpiryNotifier.setToken} keeps the
 * notifier's sense of the *current* token in sync (the session module calls it
 * on construction, hydrate, and every `setToken`), which is what a reported
 * request-token is compared against to spot a stale, already-rotated 401.
