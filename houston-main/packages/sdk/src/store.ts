/**
 * The reactive core of the SDK: a scope-keyed snapshot store plus a global
 * event channel.
 *
 * **Model — snapshots, not patches.** Every reactive surface is addressed by a
 * string *scope* (`"connection"`, `"agents"`, `"conversation/<id>"`). A module
 * owns a scope and, whenever its state changes, `publish`es the WHOLE new
 * snapshot for that scope. Subscribers receive the complete value — there is no
 * diff/patch protocol to reconcile. Houston's event rates are UI-scale, so the
 * simplicity of "latest wins" beats the bookkeeping of incremental patches (see
 * README "why snapshots-not-patches").
 *
 * Everything crossing `getSnapshot`/`subscribe`/`emitEvent`/`onEvent` is plain
 * JSON — no functions, no class instances — so it can traverse a
 * structured-clone boundary unchanged.
 */

/**
 * A fire-and-forget notification broadcast on the global event channel,
 * distinct from a scope snapshot. Used for one-shot signals (toasts, errors,
 * lifecycle) that are not themselves reactive state. JSON-serializable.

 * **Re-entrancy safety.** `publish` and `emitEvent` iterate over a *copy* of
 * the current listener set, so a callback may freely `subscribe`/unsubscribe
 * (including unsubscribing itself) mid-notification without corrupting the
 * iteration. A listener removed during a `publish` is not observed on the
 * *next* publish; whether it still receives the in-flight notification is
 * unspecified (it is iterating a snapshot taken before it was removed).
 *
 * **Listener isolation.** A throwing listener never reaches the publisher or
 * its sibling listeners: the snapshot is already stored, every other listener
 * still runs, and the error is rethrown on its own microtask so it surfaces on
 * the host's uncaught-error path (log + Sentry) instead of aborting the turn
 * machinery mid-frame. A UI binding's failure is never the data flow's.
