/**
 * Agents contract: the `agents` view-model reflects the host's `GET /agents`,
 * and a change made by ANOTHER client (an out-of-band `AgentsChanged` on the
 * `/v1/events` reactivity feed) live-updates the snapshot without a manual
 * refresh.
 *
 * The `AgentsViewModel` is the snapshot every subscriber reads (the dispatch
 * path, the adapter, a test), so its seed shape is pinned here as API.
