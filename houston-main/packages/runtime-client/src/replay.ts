 * Shared sequencing + resume semantics for conversation event streams — the

 * host's turn relay), next to the snapshot reducer for the same reason: both
 * sides of the wire must agree exactly.
 *
 * A ReplayLog owns a conversation's seq counter (strictly monotonic from 1,
 * process-lifetime — never reset) and a ring buffer of the in-flight turn's
 * sequenced frames, so a reconnecting client can resume with `?after=<seq>`
 * (or `Last-Event-ID`) without a gap or a duplicate. The buffer covers the
 * in-flight turn only: the owner clears it right after publishing a terminal
 * frame; a cursor the buffer can no longer serve falls back to a `resync`
 * sync + history refetch, which after turn end is complete and correct.
