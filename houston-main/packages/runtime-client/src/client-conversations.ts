/**
 * The conversation-record half of {@link HoustonEngineClient}: listing chats,
 * reading a transcript window, and the lifecycle writes over one chat (cancel,
 * mode, dismiss, truncate, import, rename, delete, title).
 *
 * Split out of `./client.ts` for size, not for reach — these are methods OF the
 * conversation client, so they stay on it, and the base declares only the
 * transport it needs ({@link json}). What does NOT live here is the live half:
 * `sendMessage` and `streamEvents` stay beside the requester in `./client.ts`,
 * because they are the only two calls that use the raw {@link Requester}
 * (a 202 with no body, an SSE body read frame by frame) rather than JSON.
 *
 * CHAIN — this extends {@link EngineCredentialClient} only so that
 * {@link HoustonEngineClient} has ONE parent. The two bases are size splits of
 * a single class, not a hierarchy: neither knows anything about the other, and
 * the order they are chained in carries no meaning. `client-auth.ts` is the
 * root (it extends nothing), and `client.ts` supplies the transport both
 * declare.
