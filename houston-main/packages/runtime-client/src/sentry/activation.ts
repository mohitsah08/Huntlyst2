/**
 * Whether the TS engine reports to Sentry, and with what identity — resolved
 * PURELY from the process environment so both engine processes (host and
 * runtime) and both runtimes (Node in pods/dev/self-host, the Bun-compiled
 * desktop sidecar) share ONE rule.
 *
 * The rule mirrors the desktop app's HOU-469 contract:
 * `dsn_present && (production_context || SENTRY_SEND_IN_DEV)`.
 *
 * - No `SENTRY_DSN` → dormant. The credential IS the switch: the desktop app
 *   injects the DSN into the sidecar only when its own gate passed, the
 *   engine-pod image bakes it at build, self-hosters set their own. Nothing
 *   is baked into source.
 * - A DSN in a DEV run (source-run via tsx/vitest — neither the compiled
 *   sidecar, nor NODE_ENV=production, nor a managed pod) is suppressed unless
 *   `SENTRY_SEND_IN_DEV` opts in, so a shell-exported prod DSN can't make
 *   `pnpm dev` pollute the prod Sentry project.
