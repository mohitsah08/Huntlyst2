/**
 * The HoustonClient every frontend talks to, backed by the TS engine.
 * Boot/chat/auth map to the engine; a single synthetic workspace holds
 * localStorage-backed agents, their `.houston/**` files, and their boards.
 *
 * The ~100 methods are split into cohesive cluster **mixins** (under `client/`),
 * composed here over ONE shared {@link HoustonClientBase} → {@link AdapterContext}
 * (`client/context.ts`) so `cp`/`engine`/`sdk` and the active-org state have a
 * single source of truth. The public method surface (names + signatures) is
 * unchanged, so every caller is untouched.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO catch-all Proxy: the old adapter masked unknown
 * methods with `async () => []`, a silent-failure hazard. A method this client
 * does not define is `undefined`, so a stray call is a real TypeError the
 * caller can see and report instead of a silent `[]`.
