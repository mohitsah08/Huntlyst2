/**
 * What a 502/503/504 from the gateway MEANS, and how long a read waits on each
 * meaning. The reading itself; `transient-retry.ts` is the transport that acts
 * on it.
 *
 * The managed cloud runs one engine pod per agent and lets it sleep. Opening a
 * chat fires a burst of reads (`read_agent_file`, `list_routines`,
 * `get_skills_manifest`, `list_project_files`) at a pod that may still be
 * booting, and the gateway answers each of them 503. Those 503s are NOT all the
 * same event, and treating them alike is what made a normal cold start look
 * like a crash (HOU-1153):
 *
 *  - **The pod is waking.** `{"error":"engine unavailable"}` is the gateway's
 *    UPSTREAM-ENGINE BUCKET (its own words, `cloud/internal/edge/missions/
 *    routes.go`): every producer of it is a pod that is not serving YET — the
 *    dispatch self-heal path's ensure-awake leg
 *    (`cloud/internal/edge/agents/routes.go` → `wakeBlocking`, detail
 *    `"agent is waking"`), and assistant discovery's provision / teardown /
 *    credential-mint legs (`cloud/internal/edge/agents/assistant.go`), each
 *    with its own detail and a `Retry-After`. The DETAIL is prose that varies
 *    per leg; the error string is the contract, so it alone decides. Nothing
 *    went wrong; the answer simply isn't ready yet.
 *  - **The deployment does not run this feature.** The shared-skills routes
 *    answer `503 {"error":"shared skills not configured"}` when the gateway has
 *    no blob store bound (`cloud/internal/edge/shared_skills_routes.go`), and
 *    every credential-gated route answers `503 {..., "code":"not_configured"}`
 *    when its credential is absent (assistant discovery, the certificate
 *    routes). That is a deployment SHAPE, permanent for the session: retrying
 *    burns round trips to be told the same thing.
 *  - **The pod is not accepting connections.** The gateway's per-agent proxy
 *    (`cloud/internal/proxy/forward.go` → `connectWithRetry`) walks a short
 *    dial ladder against a pod it believes is running and, when every dial is
 *    refused, answers `502 {"error":"engine proxy failed","detail":<dial
 *    error>}`. On a read that is the same event as a wake, seen from the other
 *    side: the pod is restarting under an engine roll (a deploy re-rolls every
 *    agent pod), or was just replaced, and the very same request answers once
 *    it listens again. Every deploy day produced a burst of these on the
 *    passive per-agent reads (`list_skills`, `read_agent_file`, ...) that got
 *    the short handoff patience and then surfaced as a bug (PRODUCT-1403 /
 *    HOUSTON-APP-4WQ) — for a pod that was up again seconds later.
 *  - **Anything else** — a gateway roll, a load-balancer handoff, a host that
 *    is restarting — heals in about a second, which is what the original two
 *    blind retries were sized for (HOU-731).
 *
 * The BODY is the contract this file keys on: it carries the REASON, and the
 * reason — not a duration — picks the schedule below. `Retry-After` says only
 * "how long", and only where the responder exposes it cross-origin, so it can
 * never classify; it is captured at the throw site onto
 * `HoustonEngineError.retryAfterMs` (`packages/wire-types/src/retry-after.ts`).
 *
 * ── Why suppressing the wake toast is not a silent failure ──────────────────
 * The no-silent-failures policy (`CLAUDE.md`) requires every failure a
 * user-initiated action produces to reach the user. A wake 503 that this layer
 * retries to success is not a failure the action produced — the action
 * SUCCEEDED, a little later. Toasting it would report a non-problem and train
 * users to ignore the red toast. When the budget below is exhausted the error
 * is rethrown verbatim and toasts exactly as before, and every other 503 shape
 * keeps its old, short patience. Suppression is bounded by success; nothing is
 * swallowed.
