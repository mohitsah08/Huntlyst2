 * All of it is client-side branching the SDK deliberately does not do — colour
 * is a device pick mirrored up to the account's `agent_colors` preference
 * (`./agent-color-sync`), not a field the agent routes carry. The single-request
 * host leaf that writes a colour is `updateAgentColor` in the SDK's agents
 * module; both land in the SAME durable store, so a colour set by the assistant
 * is the colour the app renders, and vice versa.
