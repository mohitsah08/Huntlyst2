 * single-flight session refresh, one replay with a genuinely new token, and
 * the quiet synthetic signed-out answer for every 401 whose outcome is already
 * known (session gone, or a bearer the gateway has already rejected). A 401 to
 * the replay of a NEW bearer is returned as-is: that is a real bug and must

 * still settling — HOU-1106) throws the transport-shaped TypeError
 * `refreshLiveToken` mints, exactly as if the request itself had dropped:
 * `transientRetryFetch` re-attempts reads (re-running the refresh each time),
 * and a persistent failure surfaces as connectivity, never as a bogus auth
 * error. With no refresher installed (static tokens, tests) the refresh
 * resolves null and this degrades to a plain live-token fetch.
 *
 * With NO bearer at all in hosted mode the request is not sent: the refresher
 * is asked once (bridging the boot race where queries fire before the restored
 * session's token is mirrored), and when it confirms there is no session the
 * call resolves to a synthetic signed-out 401 locally. The bearer it DOES hand
 * back is not trusted blindly: on a wake burst it can be the slept-out token
 * re-read from storage, so its response settles through the same recovery as
 * any other attempt (PRODUCT-1737).
