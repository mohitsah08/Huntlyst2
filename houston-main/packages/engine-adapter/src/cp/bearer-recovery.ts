 * gateway has rejected a bearer. Split out so the transport file stays
 * readable and so the one piece of state this needs — which bearers the
 * gateway has ALREADY rejected — has a single owner.
 *
 * Why that memory exists (PRODUCT-1737): on a wake-from-sleep burst the bearer
 * the gateway sees is not one value. Several parallel reads go out holding the
 * slept-out token, the proactive identity timer mints a new one on its own
 * schedule, and the seam's refresh answers a third caller. Comparing the
 * refresher's answer only with the bearer THIS request sent (`fresh ===
 * bearer`, PRODUCT-1664) cannot tell "the gateway has already rejected this
 * exact token on a sibling request" apart from "a genuinely new mint". The
 * first replay of a rejected mint stays loud — a fresh bearer the gateway
 * refuses is a real bug — but its siblings must not each file the same
 * report, and a request that only learned of the rejection from a sibling
 * must not fire a replay it already knows the answer to.
