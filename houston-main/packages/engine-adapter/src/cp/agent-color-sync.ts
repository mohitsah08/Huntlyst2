 * Durable home for agent colors: the `agent_colors` ACCOUNT preference
 * (PRODUCT-1344). The localStorage overlay (`./agent-color`) is only the
 * DEVICE copy, and sign-out purges every account-scoped `houston.*` key
 * (PRODUCT-1235) — so a device-only color died with the session and every
 * agent came back default-purple, with nothing server-side to restore from.
 * Same shape as the overlay (agent id → color), stored as one JSON blob
 * behind `/v1/preferences/:key`, which the local host, self-host, and the
 * cloud gateway all serve (the PRODUCT-1282 `onboarding_completed` pattern).
 *
 * Flow: every `listAgents` reconciles the two copies. Entries only the device
 * holds always survive, so a pre-fix device map is healed UP and becomes
 * durable. Which copy wins a SHARED id depends on whether this device still
 * owes the account a write: while a pick is unsaved the device wins (its pick
 * must not be overwritten by the copy it is about to replace), and once the
 * account has accepted it the account wins — that is what carries a color set
 * on another device, or by the assistant's `updateAgentColor`, onto this one.
