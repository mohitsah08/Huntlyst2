/**
 * Subscribe to the host's global reactivity stream (`GET /v1/events`, SSE).
 *
 * A thin consumer of the shared `streamGlobalEvents` loop
 * (`@houston/runtime-client`), which uses fetch + a ReadableStream reader, NOT
 * `EventSource`: in the Tauri desktop webview a cross-origin `EventSource` to
 * the host silently never connects, so the desktop would get zero reactivity
 * (the board/routines/etc. only refresh on navigation). fetch streaming works
 * in both the webview and the browser — it's the same transport the chat stream
 * already relies on.
 *
 * This adapter keeps only its own two seams: the token rides in the query (the
 * host's bearer reads `?token=`, re-embedded per (re)connect so a refreshed
 * token is always current) — and, in a hosted team space, the active-space
 * slug rides beside it as `?org=<slug>` (C8 §Active space: browsers can't set
 * headers on a stream, so the gateway's two SSE routes accept the selector as a
 * query param). Both are re-read per (re)connect. Host events
 * `{ type, agentPath, workspaceId }`
 * are translated to the shape the UI's invalidation map reads
 * (`{ type, data: { agent_path, workspace_id } }`). Malformed frames are
 * dropped and the loop reconnects with a short backoff on any drop. A `401`
 * forces a session refresh (single-flight, HOU-687) so the next attempt's
 * re-read of `liveToken` carries a valid bearer — without it, an expired token
 * would 401-loop forever because nothing else re-mints while the app idles.
 */
/**
 * Gateways whose event feed has already streamed at least once in this page's
 * lifetime — the "is this a reconnect?" memory behind the catch-up seam below.
 *
 * Module-scoped, NOT per-subscription, because the reconnect that matters most
 * replaces the subscription itself: a `401` refreshes the session, and
 * `setHostedEngineSessionToken` rebuilds the whole client (`_ws.disconnect()`
 * then `_ws.connect()`), so the stream that comes back after the longest gap —
 * the laptop that slept until its token expired — arrives on a BRAND-NEW
 * `subscribeEvents` call. A per-call counter restarted at zero there and the
 * one reconnect that had lost the most events was the one that stayed silent.
 *
 * Keyed by gateway, not by token or space: the token is exactly what changes
 * across a refresh, and the active space is mutated in place on the SAME
 * subscription (`cfg.activeOrgSlug`, read live per connect). Page lifetime is
 * the right scope on both ends — a real fresh boot starts with an empty set and
 * stays silent (its initial reads are already in flight), and nothing here
 * outlives the reload that would make the memory wrong.
