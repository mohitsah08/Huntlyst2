// The "is this failure just the agent's pod not reachable yet?" classifier for
// the error-surfacing layer (HOU-1114, PRODUCT-1403). Dependency-free so it is
// node-testable directly (app/tests/engine-waking-error.test.ts) and
// importable from anywhere.
//
// It lives in the engine adapter, not app/src/lib: the adapter is bundled by
// BOTH the desktop app and the web shell (each depends on the workspace
// package, resolved through pnpm's symlink — there is no alias), and only the
// web build can resolve `@houston/app/*`. An adapter import of app code broke
// every desktop release build while the web build passed.
// app/src/lib/engine-waking-error.ts re-exports this module for the app's own
// call sites.
//
// On the hosted profile the gateway has two ways of saying "the agent's engine
// pod is not there right now", both of which self-heal on retry once the pod
// listens again — nothing in Houston broke, so the bug-report pipeline (Sentry
// capture + the error surface) is the wrong place for either:
//
//  - `503 {"error": "engine unavailable"}` — the pod is not reachable yet: a
//    freshly installed store agent still provisioning, or an asleep pod mid
//    cold-start (HOU-1114: a user who just installed an agent read the red
//    toast as the install failing).
//  - `502 {"error": "engine proxy failed", "detail": <dial error>}` — the
//    gateway's per-agent proxy exhausted its dial ladder against a pod it
//    believes is running: the pod is restarting under an engine roll (every
//    deploy re-rolls every agent pod) or was just replaced. Every deploy day
//    produced a burst of these on the passive per-agent reads (`list_skills`,
//    `read_agent_file`, ...), each captured as a bug for a pod that was up
//    again seconds later (PRODUCT-1403 / HOUSTON-APP-4WQ).
//
// Keyed on the exact (status, gateway reason) pairs, NOT on bare 502/503:
// other bodies on the same statuses (provider quota pages, self-host proxies)
// carry different reasons and must keep surfacing as real errors. The read
// transport (`packages/engine-adapter/src/cp/transient-retry.ts`) parses
// the same two answers on the wire and gives them the cold-start retry budget
// first; this classifier decides how the ones that outlive that budget
// surface.
//
// A third "not there yet" answer comes from the HOST itself, not the gateway:
// `503 {"error":"the agent's runtime is still starting, try again shortly"}`
// (`packages/host/src/channel/probe-wake.ts`). The read-only probe routes
// (`/providers`, `/providers/usage`, `/auth/status`) race the agent runtime's
// boot against a short deadline and answer this plus `Retry-After: 2` rather
// than hold the socket for the whole cold boot. The boot keeps running; the
// retry meets a live runtime. Same waking state, a different reason string,
// and it escaped into the red toast + Sentry pipeline because only the two
// gateway reasons were matched (HOUSTON-APP-54Q).
//
// A fourth answer is the HOST refusing because it is DRAINING (a release
// roll, an autoscaler eviction, the desktop quitting): once the launcher has
// latched closed (PRODUCT-1399) the per-agent proxy answers every route
// `503 {"error":"the host is shutting down; retry shortly"}` + `Retry-After`,
// and the same request succeeds against the replacement pod. Since pods
// really drain for their whole grace period (PRODUCT-1758) that window is
// long enough for a chat open to land in it; only the three reasons above
// were matched, so it rode the handoff budget and then surfaced as a bug
// (PRODUCT-1777 / HOUSTON-APP-56Z). The host now answers the gateway's
// `engine unavailable` pair for this state; the raw reason stays matched for
// pods still on the older host during the roll that ships the change.
//
// A fifth is the HOST's rename latch (`launcher/process.ts` hold, HOU-827):
// while a rename moves the agent's directory the old id is refused for a few
// seconds, and the app's own reconnect storm arrives with that id. The host
// answers the same `engine unavailable` pair with the latch as detail
// (PRODUCT-1804), so nothing here reads the detail.
//
// Four client stacks reach the host, minting different error shapes (the
// split `@houston/sdk`'s refusal readers also handle, plus the runtime client):
//
//  - `HoustonEngineError` (legacy adapter): message is
//    `"<reason> (engine error <status>)"`, reason verbatim — prefix-matched.
//  - `AgentsHttpError` (the SDK agent-write path: rename/create/delete) and
//    `ActivitiesHttpError` (the SDK activity-write path: mission create /
//    delete): the message is the gateway's RAW JSON body, so the reason is
//    parsed out of it. Renaming an asleep agent answered the same wake 503 but
//    escaped this classifier into the red toast + Sentry pipeline because only
//    the legacy shape was matched (HOUSTON-APP-536); a mission created against
//    a pod mid-roll did the same through the activities module, which carries
//    the body identically but wasn't in the name list (HOUSTON-APP-51X).
//  - `EngineError` (`@houston/runtime-client` — the per-agent runtime and the
//    pre-agent setup-runtime clients): carries the raw response text in
//    `body`, so the reason is parsed the same way. First-run provider login
//    against a setup pod still provisioning answered
//    `503 {"error":"engine unavailable","detail":"setup pod unreachable"}` but
//    escaped into the red toast + Sentry pipeline because this shape wasn't
//    matched (PRODUCT-1612 / HOUSTON-APP-4VN).
//
// The SDK write branch additionally treats `502 {"error":"agent pod
// unusable"}` as a wake: on the gateway's agent-write routes that reason is
// minted exactly when the engine PATCH/seed round-trip to the pod fails at the
// transport level (`cloud/internal/edge/agents/routes.go` renameAgent) — the
// observed shape is a rename retried seconds into a cold start, where the pod
// accepts connections but hasn't answered before the gateway's deadline. The
// gateway logs every such failure server-side ("agent pod unusable during
// rename"), so classifying it quiet here loses no observability. On the legacy
// shape "agent pod unusable" keeps surfacing as a real error: there it arrives
// from the dispatch path, where a wedged pod is a bug we want reported.
