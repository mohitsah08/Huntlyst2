 *   would churn every entry id and force a full remount) but record the
 *   server window so load-older knows where the loaded feed starts.
 * - `skip`: the feed holds something the fold lacks (an unconfirmed
 *   optimistic send, a raced read resolving after a settle, or pages already
 *   loaded below the fold's window) — keep everything as is.
 *
 * The comparison anchors on USER-MESSAGE CONTENT (the turn skeleton), never
 * on frame timestamps: live pushes are stamped with the CLIENT clock while
 * history folds carry the runtime's `ChatMessage.ts` — two different clock
 * domains that cannot be ordered against each other (a cache written at
 * settle time would routinely compare "newer" than the authoritative tail).
 *
 * `currentHasWindow` = the feed already carries a stamped `historyWindow`
 * (a prior windowed seed / loaded pages): a same-content, shorter fold then
 * skips instead of discarding the loaded pages, while an UNSTAMPED longer
 * paint (a cache) is replaced so the on-screen feed maps to real server
 * indices before load-older arms.
