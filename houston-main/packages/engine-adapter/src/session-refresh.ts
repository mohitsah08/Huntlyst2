/**
 * The hosted-session refresh seam: when the gateway answers 401, the transport
 * asks the app layer for a freshly-minted Supabase access token and replays the
 * request, so an expired bearer never surfaces to the user (HOU-687).
 *
 * The app layer (desktop `EngineGate`, web `CloudApp`) installs the refresher on
 * `window.__HOUSTON_SESSION_REFRESH__` — the same global-injection idiom as
 * `__HOUSTON_ENGINE__` — because this adapter must not import the Supabase
 * client: auth ownership stays with the shell that configured it. No refresher
 * installed (static-token hosts, dev bearers, tests) → refresh resolves null
 * and the original 401 stands.
 *
 * The refresher's answer is three-valued, and the distinction is load-bearing
 * (HOU-1106): a token means refreshed, null means the session is terminally
 * gone (a real sign-out — the transport answers with the quiet signed-out 401,
 * since the sign-in screen is that state's surface), and a TRANSIENT
 * failure — the identity service unreachable while a sleep-wake reconnect
 * settles — THROWS. Both installers already speak this contract: the desktop's
 * `refreshNow()` rethrows `IdentityError("network")` precisely so callers
 * retry instead of signing the user out, and the web's `getIdToken(true)`
 * throws FirebaseError `auth/network-request-failed`. Flattening that throw to
 * null (as this seam once did) turned every wake-from-sleep refresh race into
 * a bogus "invalid or expired token" red toast + Sentry report.
