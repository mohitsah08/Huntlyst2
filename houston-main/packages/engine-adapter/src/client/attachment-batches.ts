/**
 * The browser half of an upload: turning dropped `File`s into the JSON frames
 * the host stores, in batches small enough to send.
 *
 * It stays in the web adapter because `File` and `webkitRelativePath` are DOM
 * types — `@houston/sdk` is deployment-agnostic and cannot depend on them —
 * while the requests themselves live in `sdk.files`. The split is also what
 * keeps memory flat: a batch is framed only when it is about to be sent, so a
 * 2 GB folder drop never holds more than one batch of base64 at once.
 *
 * Shared by composer attachments and the Files section's own upload (HOU-889),
 * which is why the plan and the framing live beside each other rather than in
 * either caller.
