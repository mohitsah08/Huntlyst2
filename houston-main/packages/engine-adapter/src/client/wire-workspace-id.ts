/**
 * Translates the workspace id the UI holds into the one the SERVER answers to.
 *
 * The personal space is the SYNTHETIC "default" client-side (`workspaces-mixin`
 * replaces the served personal row with it; its id is load-bearing for prefs,
 * caches and the desktop boot path). No server speaks that vocabulary: the local
 * host's personal workspace id is its folder name (`~/.houston/workspaces/<Name>`)
 * and the gateway's is its fixed engine id ("Houston") — both answer 404
 * "workspace not found" for "default". Team spaces (`org:<slug>`) bridge through
 * with their real ids and pass through untouched.
 *
 * One resolver per client (held on {@link AdapterContext}), so the `/v1/workspaces`
 * round trip is paid once no matter how many surfaces need the translation —
 * shared skills and the sidebar layout both do.
