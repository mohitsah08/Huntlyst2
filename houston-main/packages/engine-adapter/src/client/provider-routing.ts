/**
 * The space-safety rules for routing PROVIDER calls (HOU-979).
 *
 * Cloud routes provider connects and probes at a specific agent's runtime, and
 * the ONLY space-validated source for that id is `ctx.agentList` — the set the
 * CURRENT space's last `listAgents` returned (cleared by `setActiveOrg` the
 * moment the space changes). The persisted `last_agent_id` pref is not
 * space-aware: right after a space switch it still names an agent that belongs
 * to the space the user just left, so routing on it produces
 * `/v1/agents/<other-space-agent>/…` under the NEW `x-houston-org` header. That
 * 404/403 is what surfaced as "the chat picker shows no providers", "the
 * reconnect card never clears", and "the AI hub still says Connected".
 *
 * So: one accessor, and an explicit refusal instead of a guess. Free functions
 * over the context (like `provider-login-poll` / `provider-claude-push`) rather
 * than more methods on it, so this whole concern reads in one place.
 *
 * Strictness applies ONLY while a list is still expected. A list that was asked
 * for and could not be had (`unavailable`) must not brick the app: refusing
 * forever left the picker pinned on "Loading providers…" and every connect
 * throwing "still loading", with no retry. There the client degrades to the
 * pre-HOU-979 pref-based routing, and the next successful list restores strict
 * validation.

 *
 * Two distinct refusals, because they mean different things to the user:
 * a `pending` list is "still loading, try again" (a moment), while a settled
 * list with no agent is the typed `NoAgentForProviderWriteError` ("create an
 * agent first") — an expected state the app surfaces as plain guidance, not a
 * bug (PRODUCT-1662). Credential writes (connect, sign-out) must NOT use this:
