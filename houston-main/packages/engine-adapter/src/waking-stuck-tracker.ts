/**
 * Per-agent "still waking" bookkeeping for the stuck-wake escalation
 * (PRODUCT-1640). Dependency-free so it unit-tests under node:test
 * (app/tests/waking-stuck-tracker.test.ts); the executor is the app's
 * `quiet-error-report.ts`.
 *
 * Lives in the engine adapter, not app/src/lib, because `./cp/fetch.ts` is a
 * writer and the adapter ships in the desktop bundle, which cannot resolve
 * `@houston/app/*` (see ./engine-waking-error.ts). The app reaches it through
 * the app/src/lib/waking-stuck-tracker.ts re-export, so both sides share this
 * one module instance.
 *
 * Every waking answer (HOU-1114 / PRODUCT-1403) is an expected state and is
 * captured only as a low-noise warning. But an agent that answers NOTHING but
 * waking for longer than the gateway's own 300s `ensureAwake` hold is no longer
 * "still starting": the pod is crashlooping or never scheduled, and that is a
 * bug we want as an error-level Sentry event — exactly ONE per stuck episode,
 * carrying the first and last raw bodies so the shape of the failure (a DNS
 * dial error turning into a refused connection, say) is readable from the
 * issue.
 *
 * An episode is a run of waking answers from one agent with no gap longer
 * than `gapMs` between consecutive answers: a burst hours apart is two cold
 * starts, not one stuck wake. Any successful call to the agent
 * (`noteSuccess`, fed by the gateway fetch) ends the episode outright.
