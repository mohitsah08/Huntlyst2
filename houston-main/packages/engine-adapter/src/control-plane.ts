/**
 * Control-plane surface for the web adapter — the barrel over the cohesive
 * modules under `cp/`. In cloud, the web app talks to the Houston control plane
 * (not a single local runtime): agents are REAL and a conversation is proxied to
 * the agent's sandbox, so chat reuses the exact same `HoustonEngineClient` +
 * `streamTurn` path pointed at `${baseUrl}/agents/${agentId}`.
 *
 * This file is the ONE import site every caller and the test suite uses
 * (`import … from "./control-plane"`) — the mixins import it as a namespace and
 * the web tests `vi.mock("…/control-plane")` it — so the split into `cp/*`
 * modules is invisible to consumers. `ControlPlaneConfig` and the shared
 * transport live in `cp/fetch.ts`.

// The type surface callers reference (some as `controlPlane.<Type>`). Re-exported
