/**
 * Queue-while-running: a send that arrives while the conversation's turn is
 * still streaming is HELD (rendered as a removable queued bubble via the VM's
 * `queued` list) and flushed as ONE combined send when the turn settles —
 * several quick follow-ups become a single coherent turn instead of a pile of
 * back-to-back turns.
 *
 * Owned by the adapter (behind the client's `startSession`) so EVERY send path
 * — chat panel, mission control, skills, onboarding — inherits it without each
 * call site re-deriving "is a turn active". The queue holds fully BUILT
 * requests (attachments already saved, prompt final); `queuedPreview` carries
 * the user's words + attachment names for the composer's queued-bubble UI.
 *
 * Flushing has three triggers, because a settle has two shapes and one
 * failure mode: the dispatched turn's own settle (the `.finally` in
 * `chat-send-mixin`); for a turn settled by anything else, the settle watcher
 * armed at queue time (see settle-watcher.ts; HOU-718's reconnect
 * auto-continue was the canonical victim of its absence); and the queue
 * watchdog (queue-watchdog.ts), the ground-truth history probe that flushes a
 * queue whose settle-watcher trigger silently died — a fatal or exhausted
 * observer stream left the stale `running` flag unhealed and the queued
 * resume sat forever (HOU-849).
 *
 * `autoResume` sends (Houston resuming after a provider reconnect — not
 * user-typed) get special handling: one resume per conversation at a time —
 * a duplicate is swallowed while another is queued OR dispatched-and-running
 * (several reconnect surfaces fire the same resume off one login event) — a
 * held one is dropped at flush when the user queued their own follow-up
 * (their message resumes the conversation by itself), it never renders a
 * queued bubble (a hidden system message stays hidden while held), and its
 * watchdog probes immediately so a stale hold clears within one round-trip.
