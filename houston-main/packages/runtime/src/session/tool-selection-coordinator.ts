/**
 * The personal assistant's whole tool surface. Everything here either operates
 * Houston, records the turn's interaction lifecycle, or hands work to an agent.
 *
 * `read` + `write` are the ONE file pair it keeps, and only because memory
 * consolidation needs exactly them: a full memory is answered with "read that
 * file, merge it, write the trimmed list back" (routes/learning-write.ts), and
 * both halves are clamped to its own directory by the workspace guard. No
 * `edit`/`ls`/`grep`/`find` — none of them is on that path. No `bash`,
 * `run_code`, integration execution or skill tools: those DO work, and work belongs on an
 * agent's board where the user can see it.
