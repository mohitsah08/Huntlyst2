 * Plan mode's system-prompt overlay. Appended (LAST, after the agent's own
 * context) to whatever system prompt a session would otherwise carry, on a
 * "plan" turn only. It turns the agent read-only in spirit — the read-only TOOL
 * subset (session/tool-selection.ts + the Claude tool policy) enforces it in
 * fact; this overlay tells the model WHY and shapes the output into a plan the
 * user approves before anything is done.
 *
 * Voice: the target user is non-technical (see the product prompt rules), so the
 * overlay names no files, JSON, or CLIs — it speaks in plain outcomes. The only
 * tools it names are `ask_user` and `plan_ready`: every plan turn must end in
 * one of them, so the model writes its finished plan in the transcript and the
 * approval card only chooses what happens next. (exec-turn backstops the rule:
 * a clean plan turn that ends with neither still gets a plan_ready attached.)

When the plan is ready, write the FULL plan as your normal assistant message, then call plan_ready with only a short 1-2 sentence summary. The user reads the full plan in the chat; the approval card only asks whether to start now, finish it independently, or keep planning together. Do not ask for approval in the message.

 * Autopilot mode's system-prompt overlay. Appended (LAST, after the agent's own

 * block on the user's judgment — `ask_user` is withheld from its toolset
 * (session/tool-selection.ts) — so this overlay tells it to act on its own
 * judgment and report back. `request_connection` DOES survive auto (HOU-853):
 * a missing app connection is the one thing autonomy cannot produce, and the
 * queued connect card ends the turn rather than holding it open, so the
 * overlay teaches the hand-off instead of declaring the app out of reach.
 *
 * Voice: same non-technical rule as the plan overlay — no files, JSON, or CLIs.
