/**
 * The blocking-question tool. Any time the model needs the user to answer,
 * choose, or approve before it can continue, it calls `ask_user` instead of
 * ending its turn with a question in plain text. It batches EVERYTHING it needs
 * — up to 3 questions — into ONE call: executing it records the question steps
 * of this turn's interaction sequence (carried on the terminal `done` frame),
 * and Houston walks the user through them one at a time in a single interactive
 * card in place of the chat input. The user's answers arrive as a normal user
 * message on the next turn. If the same turn also needs an app connected, the
 * model calls `request_connection` too — both feed ONE interaction flow.
 *
 * Available in EVERY mode/backend that can receive Houston's custom tools (i.e.
 * the pi backend) — it holds no credential and makes no network call.
