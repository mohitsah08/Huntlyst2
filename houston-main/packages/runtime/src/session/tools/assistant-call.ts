/**
 * `houston_call` — the one tool that PERFORMS a catalogued Houston operation.
 *
 * It holds no credential and it holds no approval: it carries only the
 * per-sandbox HMAC token to the host's `/sandbox/assistant/call`, and the host
 * is what knows the gateway URL, the gateway token, which operations it will
 * actually route, and whether the USER approved this exact call. Validation is
 * duplicated on purpose — here so the model gets a correctable answer, there so
 * a sandbox token alone can never reach an unrouted or unapproved operation.
 *
 * `confirm: true` operations go through `assistant-confirm.ts` first, which asks
 * the HOST to raise the card and hands back the `requestId` the model presents
 * on its next call. There is deliberately NO "confirmed" input: an approval the
 * model could assert is not an approval, and a `requestId` is worthless until
 * the user's own reply turns it into a receipt in the host.
