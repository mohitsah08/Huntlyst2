/**
 * The integration_search speech acts around the app scope (PRODUCT-1274):
 * what to tell the model when a scoped search came back empty, and the
 * leading notes when the results are NOT certainly the named app's. Split
 * from integrations.ts (the tool plumbing) so the messages live in one place.
 *
 * The host's response carries two flags the speech act depends on:
 *  - `unscopedFallback`: every provider RESOLVED nothing for the scope (a
 *    typo, a guess) and the items are one unscoped retry — other apps'.
 *  - `scopeIgnored`: some provider (a gateway predating the scope contract)
 *    ignored the scope entirely, so the items may be unscoped noise and an
 *    EMPTY result proves nothing about the app existing. Never render a
 *    confident "no such app" over this flag.
