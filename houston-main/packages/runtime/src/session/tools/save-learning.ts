/**
 * The agent's structured tool to SAVE a learning (a stable fact or preference
 * the agent should carry into future sessions).
 *
 * WHY it exists: the product prompt used to tell the agent to edit
 * `.houston/learnings/learnings.json` with file tools. Two problems with that.
 * (1) It is the same wholesale-write hazard `save_routine` was created for — a
 * model that rewrites the array drops everything it did not happen to read.
 * (2) A learning has PROVENANCE the agent cannot know or be trusted to write:
 * WHO taught it and WHICH mission it came from. Both are derived server-side —
 * the person from the gateway-minted acting-as header, the mission from the
 * turn's conversation id — so the tool takes only the learning's text.
 *
 * Same trust posture as the other host-proxying tools: it holds no secret and
 * carries only the per-sandbox HMAC token; the host resolves the sandbox to its
 * workspace, stamps provenance, and owns the merge-safe write.
