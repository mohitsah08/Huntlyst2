 * generated catalog carries the missing half on each parameter — the author's
 * own sentence (`description`) and the operation that LISTS its accepted
 * values (`source`) — so the contract is rendered with both, and the closing
 * paragraph names, parameter by parameter, where each value is to be read
 * from. A model that knows to call `listAgents` first stops guessing agent
 * names on the second try instead of the fifth.
