 * turn — could be talked into dressing a trip to Billing or the Danger zone as

 * One card covers all of them — each is the same interaction ("open this
 * screen, do the thing, come back"), and none can carry its result back through
 * the runtime, so four bespoke step kinds would buy nothing.
 *
 * KNOWN DEGRADATION: a build that predates this step kind drops it on the way in
 * (`parsePendingInteraction` keeps only the kinds it recognizes), so the turn
 * ends with nothing on screen. Accepted: the alternative is the model narrating
 * the clicks in chat, which is exactly what this tool exists to replace.
