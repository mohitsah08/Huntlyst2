/**
 * The agent's setup tools for CUSTOM integrations (HOU-550): connect an API or
 * MCP server that the app catalog doesn't offer. The agent interviews the user
 * (which service? its docs/spec URL? does it need a key?), then drives these
 * tools; the user never handles the machinery.
 *
 * Same trust posture as the generic integration tools: no credential is ever
 * held here — detect/add proxy to the host's /sandbox/integrations/custom/*
 * under the per-sandbox HMAC token, and the SECRET travels only through the
 * secure card `request_credential` queues (the user types it into Houston's
 * UI, which posts it straight to the host — it never enters the transcript).
