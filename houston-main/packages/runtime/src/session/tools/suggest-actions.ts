/**
 * The follow-up-actions tool, available in execute AND auto after a mission
 * has finished. It records optional concrete next steps for the clean terminal
 * frame, which Houston renders as dismissible bubbles above the composer.
 *
 * The call ENDS the turn when the model has already written its closing
 * message: the reply and the bubbles then come from ONE model pass. Before
 * this, the result told the model "finish your final message normally", so
 * every clean turn paid a second model round-trip (a full context re-prefill)
 * whose only output was a filler closing line — the "Suggesting next steps"
 * spinner that hung under an already-complete reply, often followed by a
 * second message. pi honors the result's `terminate` hint directly (every
 * result in the batch must carry it — `suggest_reusable` does the same, so
 * the two offers may share the final message); the Claude backend mirrors it
 * with a PostToolBatch hook that reads the turn's ended mark
 * (backends/claude/turn-end-hook.ts).
 *
 * The guard: a model that calls this BEFORE writing anything visible in the
 * message carrying the call (its reply would be bubbles alone) gets the
 * non-ending result and is told to write its closing message, so a turn never
 * ends on bubbles without a reply.
 *
 * The call is mandatory on every turn that ends WITHOUT a blocking ask (the
 * product prompt requires it), yet the offer itself never blocks the user — it
 * rides the same terminal `done` frame as the blocking steps, but renders above
 * the composer instead of replacing it. It has no effect on the board status
 * (every settled turn lands `needs_you`; only the user moves a card to done).
