/**
 * The agent's structured tool to CREATE or UPDATE a scheduled task (a Routine).
 *
 * WHY it exists: the product prompt used to tell the agent to write
 * `.houston/routines/routines.json` wholesale with file tools. Each setup chat is
 * isolated and only knows its own routine, so creating task #2 overwrote the file
 * with a one-element array — deleting task #1. This tool posts to the host's
 * merge-safe sandbox route (`/sandbox/routines/save`), which reads the existing
 * file, adds or updates one entry, and writes the whole survivor set back. The
 * agent NEVER touches routines.json directly.
 *
 * Same trust posture as the integration setup tools: it holds no secret and
 * carries only the per-sandbox HMAC token; the host resolves the sandbox to its
 * workspace and owns the write. Validation failures (both/neither wake, a bad
 * cron, a trigger on a deployment that cannot fire one) come back as tool errors
 * the agent relays to the user in plain words.

 * of the routine that was running, and the run's real work never happened
 * (PRODUCT-1208). The run prompt now says so explicitly, and this is the hard
 * backstop: a run conversation (`routine-<id>`, from routineConversationId)
 * may never write routines. Setup chats are `activity-<id>`, so authoring is
