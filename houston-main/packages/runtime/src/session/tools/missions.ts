/**
 * The agent's mission-board tools (PRODUCT-1244): start a new mission, see a
 * board, and move a finished mission — so a "planning" chat can fan work out
 * into separate missions and review them, all through the SAME board the user
 * watches. Each tool acts on the calling agent's own board unless it names
 * another agent; the personal assistant, which keeps no board of its own, must
 * always name one (mission-params.ts).
 *
 * Same trust posture as `save_routine` / `save_learning`: the tools hold no
 * secret and carry only the per-sandbox HMAC token; the host owns the
 * merge-safe writes, stamps what the agent must not author (the agent-started
 * marker, attribution), resolves the named agent, fires the child turn through
 * the routine-firing channel, and enforces the guards (depth 1, running cap,
 * never the current conversation, never a running mission).
 *
 * Every refusal is a RESULT, never a throw (tool-error.ts): a missing target is
 * something the model fixes on its own turn, and only a value can hand it the
 * agents it could have named.
