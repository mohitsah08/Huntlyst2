/**
 * The secure key-entry hand-off tool (custom integrations, HOU-550). It
 * records a `credential` interaction step; Houston renders a secure entry
 * card in place of the chat input and posts the secret straight to the host —
 * the value never enters the transcript or this runtime.
 *
 * Available in EVERY acting mode, Autopilot included: an API key is the one
 * thing autonomy cannot produce, and the recorded step doesn't hold the turn
 * open — it ends the turn with the card, and the saved key auto-continues the
 * run (see AUTO_MODE_EXCLUDED_TOOL_NAMES in tool-selection.ts for the full
 * rationale).
