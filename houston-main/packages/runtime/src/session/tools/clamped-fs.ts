/**
 * Workspace-clamped file tools (cloud security Gate #1).
 *
 * pi's DEFAULT read/ls/grep/find/edit/write resolve absolute paths as-is, so a
 * prompt-injected agent could read any file the process can — including its
 * own auth.json — with no bash tool. These definitions shadow the builtins by
 * NAME (pi registers custom tools after built-ins, so same-name customs win)
 * and add two walls:
 *
 *  1. OUTER (load-bearing, all six tools): before pi's execute runs, the
 *     model-supplied `path` is resolved the way pi resolves it, validated
 *     lexically AND symlink-resolved, and rewritten to the clamped absolute
 *     path. The workspace and any configured shared roots (the org-shared
 *     mirror — agent-editable by design) are equally valid. grep/find spawn
 *     rg/fd subprocesses on that path, so this is the only wall that
 *     constrains them.
 *  2. INNER (defense in depth): edit/write/ls/grep run their filesystem access
 *     through guarded `operations` that re-validate every absolute path pi
 *     hands them. read keeps pi's default operations (its image-sniffing
 *     pipeline is internal to pi and the outer wall fully constrains its one
 *     path param); find keeps its fd engine (an operations.glob override would
 *     replace the engine, not guard it).
 *
 * rg and fd are spawned without --follow, so neither traverses symlinks during
 * a search; a symlink given directly as `path` is rejected by the outer wall.
