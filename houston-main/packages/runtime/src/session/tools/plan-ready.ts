/**
 * The plan-presentation tool — Plan mode ONLY. When the model has finished
 * planning it writes the full plan in its assistant message, then calls
 * `plan_ready` to ask what should happen next. Executing it records the single
 * plan-ready step of this turn's interaction sequence (carried on the terminal
 * `done` frame + the persisted assistant message), and Houston shows the user a
 * card with three choices — start working, hand it to Autopilot, or keep
 * planning — in place of the chat input. The model is still in Plan mode for THIS
 * turn (it cannot act), so it ends its turn right after; if the user chooses to
 * proceed, the app sends a NEW turn telling the model to begin.
 *
 * Gated to plan mode by name (`session/tool-selection.ts`): it never joins the
 * execute/auto base allowlist. It holds no credential and makes no network call.
