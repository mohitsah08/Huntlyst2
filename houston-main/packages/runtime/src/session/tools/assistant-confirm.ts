/**
 * The gate `houston_call` runs every `confirm: true` operation through.

 * NOTHING here decides an approval. The runtime asks the HOST to raise one
 * (`POST /sandbox/assistant/pending`), shows the user the card the host worded,
 * and hands the model back the host's `requestId` to present on its next call.
 * The host — the process holding the credential — is what matches that id
 * against the receipt the user's own reply minted, so a runtime that skipped
 * this gate entirely still performs nothing.
 *
 * The wording comes back from the host with the request, so the sentence the
 * person read and the bytes their yes authorizes are decided in one place and
 * cannot drift apart. The model never authors either.
