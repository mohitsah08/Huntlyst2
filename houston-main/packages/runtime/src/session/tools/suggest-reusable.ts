/**
 * The reusable-suggestion tool — the model's end-of-task REFLECTION STEP,
 * available in execute AND auto. When the model has FINISHED a task whose work
 * is clearly worth keeping (genuinely reusable, multi-step work, or a stable
 * fact worth remembering), it calls `suggest_reusable` right before its final message
 * INSTEAD OF asking the user about it in plain text or via `ask_user`. Executing
 * it records the single suggest-reusable step of this turn's interaction sequence
 * (carried on the terminal `done` frame + the persisted assistant message), and
 * Houston shows the user a dismissible card offering to save the work as a Skill,
 * a scheduled Routine, or a Learning the agent remembers for future sessions.
 *
 * CRITICALLY, this is NOT a turn-ending block like `plan_ready`: the task is
 * genuinely DONE, so the model wraps up its final message to the user as usual.
 * The suggestion is an optional offer, never something blocking completion: it
 * renders above the composer instead of replacing it (see `interaction.ts`'s
 * fallback-only precedence). It does not drive the board status — every settled
 * turn lands `needs_you` (`turn-settle.ts`'s `finishOk`) and only the user moves
 * a card to done, which the offer survives.
 *
 * It holds no credential and makes no network call, and it is name-gated OUT of
 * plan mode by `session/tool-selection.ts` (plan is read-only planning, not a
 * finished task). It reaches execute and auto because it never blocks the turn.
