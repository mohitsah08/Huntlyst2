/**
 * Guards a turn's model round-trip against a provider that goes silent — an SSE
 * read that never returns another byte and so never resolves `prompt()`.
 *
 * pi resolves a turn on success or a provider_error frame, but a stalled stream
 * resolves NEITHER and emits nothing. pi's SSE reader has no idle timeout (only
 * its WebSocket transport does), so without an external nudge the turn holds the
 * per-workspace workdir lock until the OS socket finally dies — 19 minutes in the
 * production incident, freezing every queued turn on the agent behind it.
 *
 * The watchdog is armed for the model round-trip only and reset by every wire
 * event: a healthy turn streams text/thinking/tool events continuously, so it
 * never trips; a genuinely silent stream does. Tool execution is EXEMPT — a long
 * `bash`/build is legitimately silent — so the clock is suspended while ≥1 tool
 * runs (tracked by `tool_start`/`tool_end`) and re-armed when the last one ends.
 *
 * Timer-library-agnostic (plain `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`) so tests drive it
 * with fake timers and no live session. `timeoutMs <= 0` (or non-finite) disables
 * it entirely — a fail-safe: a misconfigured timeout never fires a false abort.
