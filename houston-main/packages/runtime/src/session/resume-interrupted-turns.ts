/**

 * The settle (settle-interrupted-turns.ts) already wrote each interrupted
 * turn's reply and decided WHICH may run again — never a resume of a resume,
 * never a marker from an engine that could not record what a resume needs.
 * This module only re-sends the original prompt, framed so the model knows a
 * restart happened and what survived it (resume-prompt.ts).
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by design: it runs AFTER the server listens (a resume that
 * hung before `listen` would hold the whole engine down). A resume that never
 * starts is not silent, though: the settle already promised the user a
 * continuation, so every failure path here takes that promise back
 * (resume-revoke.ts).

 * them would fail the provider gate ("No provider connected") on an engine
