 * request and made available to the integration tools while the turn runs.
 *
 *  - `actingAs`:   the gateway's per-turn acting-as token (a live user drove the
 *                  turn) — forwarded verbatim on `/sandbox/integrations/*`.
 *  - `actingUser`: a routine creator's Supabase `sub` (a fired routine) —
 *                  forwarded so the host pairs it with the pod token upstream.
 *
 * Turn-scoping mechanism + assumption: an `AsyncLocalStorage` whose store is
 * established for the DURATION of `session.prompt()` (see chat.ts `execTurn`).
 * The tool `execute` callbacks run inside that same async context, so they read
 * the correct value with NO process-global mutation — this stays race-free even
 * when two conversations run concurrently in one runtime (a plain module-level
 * "current acting-as" would leak across them). Outside a turn (e.g. unit tests
 * calling a tool directly) the store is undefined, so no header is attached and
 * behavior is unchanged.
