/**
 * The I/O half of the conversation commands (see `conversation-command.ts` for
 * what they are and why they are matched exactly).
 *
 * A command occupies a TURN, without ever running the model: it records the
 * user's message, does its work, writes a boundary marker, and settles with
 * `done`. That shape is deliberate — every client already knows it, so the
 * composer spins and stops, a reconnecting client resumes, and the transcript
 * carries the same audit trail a channel relay would need, all without a line
 * of command-aware client code.
 *
 * The marker frames carry NO copy. The runtime is i18n-agnostic (it serves
 * users in three languages), so it emits the STRUCTURE — "the context was
 * cleared here" — and the app renders the sentence through `t()`.

/**
 * Run a command as its own turn. Fire-and-forget from the route's view, exactly
 * like `runTurn`: the outcome is delivered on the conversation's event stream,
 * never on the request that triggered it. Never rejects — a failure settles the
 * turn with an `error` frame, because a chat left spinning forever is the one
 * outcome worse than a failed command.
 *
 * SERIALIZED EXACTLY AS A TURN IS, and for the same reason: the two layers
 * `runTurn` uses are the conversation's own queue (ordering within the chat)
 * and the per-workdir lock (this workspace's files have one writer at a time),
 * and a command that skipped them would compact — or tear down — a session
 * another turn is mid-way through. The conversation's acceptance gate
 * (`conversation-command-gate.ts`) is what keeps a NEW turn from being accepted
 * behind it while it works.
