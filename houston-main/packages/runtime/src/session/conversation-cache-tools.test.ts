/**
 * PARITY GUARD for the pi backend's custom-tool registration.
 *
 * pi exposes the INTERSECTION of two independent lists: the mode's NAME
 * allowlist (`buildToolSelection` → `toolNamesForMode`, applied in
 * backends/pi/backend.ts) and the registered custom-tool OBJECTS
 * (`createPiBackend({ customTools })`). A name present in the allowlist with no
 * matching tool object is INVISIBLE to the model — silently, with no error
 * anywhere. That is exactly how `suggest_actions` shipped allowlisted but
 * unregistered on pi (the default backend for EVERY non-Anthropic provider),
 * so follow-up suggestions never appeared outside Anthropic while the product
 * prompt mandated the call on every non-blocking finish.
 *
 * These tests pin the pi set the way backends/claude/custom-tools.test.ts pins
 * the Claude set: by capturing what conversation-cache actually hands
 * `createPiBackend` at module load, under both the closed-gate and open-gate
 * configurations.
