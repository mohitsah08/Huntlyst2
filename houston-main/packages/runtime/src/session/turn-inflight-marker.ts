/**
 * The "turn in flight" marker: one small file per conversation, written the
 * moment a turn is accepted and removed when it ends — by ANY path (clean
 * done, provider error, user stop, a thrown turn). A marker that survives into
 * the next boot is therefore the one trace of a turn the previous process died
 * on: a pod OOM-killed mid-turn (one cgroup, group kill, SIGKILL leaves no
 * process to report), the desktop force-quit. The boot settle
 * (settle-interrupted-turns.ts) reads survivors, writes the honest reply the
 * dead process never could, and reports the restart — the only way the fleet
 * count of these ever reaches Sentry.
 *
 * Lives under the runtime's data dir, beside `conversations/`, so the managed
 * pod's store sync carries it to the object store with the transcript: a
 * marker that never left the pod would die with it and there would be nothing
 * to find. Own directory rather than a sibling of the conversation file: the
 * conversation lister treats every `*.json` under `conversations/` as a
 * transcript.
