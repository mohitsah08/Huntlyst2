/**
 * Boot-time settle of the turns the previous process died on (see

 * process never wrote — empty content, `interrupted` set — so a client that
 * reconnects (settle-from-history) or reloads (history replay) renders the
 * authored restart line instead of the generic dead-turn copy; report the
 * restart once, with the marker's fields, so Sentry can count them fleet-wide;
 * then drop the marker so the next boot is quiet. Runs BEFORE the server
 * listens: a client that reconnects the instant the engine is back must find
 * the reply already on disk.
 *
 * Cause inference: a marker survives only an UNCLEAN exit — every in-process
 * end of a turn clears it, and a drained shutdown lets the turn end first. So
 * "marker present at boot" IS "the process was killed mid-turn"; on a managed
 * pod that is the group OOM kill or an involuntary eviction.
