 * PRODUCT-1355: keep cached Claude sessions on the CURRENT Anthropic token.
 *
 * The Claude Agent SDK session carries its credential in the subprocess env,
 * read from the store when the session (or, since PRODUCT-1355, each prompt) is
 * prepared. A conversation touched regularly never idle-expires, so before that
 * fix a session outlived the gateway's normal token rotation and every turn on
 * it 401'd `token_revoked` forever — while the user's reconnects kept minting
 * credentials the pinned session never read (observed: 7 reconnects in 15 min
 * against one session). These two guards are the defense-in-depth around the
 * per-prompt re-read: a digest check at conversation lookup (layer 2) and an
 * eviction when a turn actually dies on a revoked token (layer 3).
 *
 * Both are scoped to the Claude backend: pi reads credentials per request via
 * the ModelRuntime, so its sessions can never pin a token.

 * turn itself would make (the whole request runs inside the acting identity,
 * HOU-976). Sessions with
 * no digest (api_key, config-dir credential) and non-Claude backends never
 * match, so they are never rebuilt from under a working setup.
