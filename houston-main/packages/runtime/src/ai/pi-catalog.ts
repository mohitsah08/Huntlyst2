/**
 * pi-ai is the model-catalog source of truth. These predicates read its LIVE
 * registry so a provider Houston hasn't hand-curated in `providers.ts` is still
 * connectable, resolvable, and runnable from a pasted API key — ADDITIVELY, and
 * without touching how the curated providers behave.
 *
 * pi surfaces three facts we key off:
 * - `getProviders()` — every provider id pi's baked catalog knows (~35, and it
 *   drifts).
 * - `Provider.auth` — how a provider can authenticate. Since pi 0.81 many
 *   api-key providers ALSO expose an optional OAuth login (xai, kimi-coding,
 *   openrouter); Houston's connect surface keeps those on the pasted-key path,
 *   so "OAuth provider" here means OAuth is the ONLY way in (openai-codex
 *   today — anthropic/github-copilot are curated `oauth` in providers.ts).
 * - `getModels(id)` — the finite catalog pi bakes for a provider (every builtin
 *   has rows: 73 for opencode, 386 for openrouter, 15 for anthropic on 0.87.1).
 *   It is pi's list, not the provider's: a gateway also routes ids pi never
 *   baked, and a row pi RENAMED leaves a stored id with no model object behind
 *   it — which is why a stored id is read through the domain rename map
 *   (`@houston/domain` provider-model) and, at turn time, `safeGetModel`.
