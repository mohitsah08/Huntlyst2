 * `codex_parser.rs` / `anthropic_classify.rs` (gethouston/houston PR #490).
 *
 * pi-ai surfaces failures as a flat string (`errorMessage`), not typed classes —
 * each provider concatenates its SDK error, e.g. `"401 {…}"` (Anthropic SDK) or
 * `"OpenAI API error (429): …"` (OpenAI) or a friendly `"You have hit your
 * ChatGPT usage limit (pro plan). Try again in ~45 min."` (Codex). So we
 * classify primarily off the message text, with the HTTP status read from a
 * diagnostic when pi attached one, else parsed out of the message.

 *

 * message of a chat hit a disconnected local model.
 *
 * pi 0.82's ModelRuntime renamed the missing-credential failure: `applyAuth`

 * credential store resolves nothing for the model's provider — and pi catches
 * that internally, so it ARRIVES as an errored AssistantMessage (the wire.ts

 * disconnected provider (pins are deliberately never auth-gated) hits exactly
 * this; without the pattern it degraded to `unknown` — the generic error card
 * instead of the reconnect card (HOU-956: "Provider is not configured:
 * google" after a Gemini model was picked with no google key stored).
 *
 * pi 0.84 added two more missing-credential shapes with the "found" dropped:
 * AgentSession.setModel throws `No API key for <provider>/<model>` and the
 * api layers throw `No API key for provider: <provider>`. On a cloud pod the
 * openai-compatible provider hits the first whenever the gateway credential
 * store served no key (not even the keyless placeholder) for a configured
 * endpoint; "no api key found" never matches either, so both degraded to
 * `unknown` — a Sentry error per turn instead of the reconnect card
