 * own endpoint and pi ships the catalog with `baseUrl: ""` — so a pasted key
 * alone can never make a request. The connect flow collects the endpoint
 * alongside the key; the key rides auth.json like every api-key provider,
 * while the endpoint persists here (its own `azure-endpoint.json`, mirroring
 * `openai-compatible.ts`'s custom-endpoint file) and is overlaid onto every
 * resolved azure model's `baseUrl` (providers.ts `safeGetModel`), which pi's
 * azure client reads when no explicit option or env var names one.
 *
 * Deployment names: pi calls the deployment named EXACTLY like the model id
 * (`resolveDeploymentName`), so a deployment must be named after its model
 * ("gpt-5.5", not "my-gpt"). The connect dialog says so.
