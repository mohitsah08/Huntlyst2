/**
 * The turn route is where every channel's message enters the runtime, so it is
 * where a conversation command has to be caught: one interception serves the
 * desktop composer and every relay that will ever forward plain text.
 *
 * It is also where the two are held apart. A command rewrites the context a
 * turn runs in, so the route may never accept both onto one conversation —
 * these tests pin BOTH refusals, and that neither one loses the message.
