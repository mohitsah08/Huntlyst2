/**
 * Narrow rollback for a failed API-key connect (PRODUCT-1321).
 *
 * The host's connect pushes the pasted key here FIRST (the runtime
 * live-verifies and persists it — api-key-route.ts `handleApiKey`), and only
 * then stores it centrally. When that central PUT fails, the runtime is left
 * holding a verified, usable key the central store never learned about: it is
 * absent from `served-providers.json`, so an authoritative central 404 can
 * never remove it (serve.ts's provenance gate), and it silently vanishes with
 * the pod's next recycle — the "spontaneous disconnect". The host calls
 * DELETE /auth/:provider/api-key to take the just-written key back out, so a
 * failed connect leaves NO local residue and the user's connect error is the
 * whole story.
 *
 * Guarded by the key itself: only the exact credential this connect wrote is
 * removed. A concurrent connect that stored a DIFFERENT key — or a served
 * OAuth entry — is left alone (`removed: false`, still a 200: rollback is a
 * convergence op, not an assertion).
