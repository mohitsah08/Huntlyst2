/**
 * GET /conversations/:id/events — the live, resumable conversation stream.
 *
 * Fresh connect (no cursor): a `sync` catch-up frame (running/partial/seq
 * watermark + the running turn's id), then live frames. Resume (`?after=<seq>`
 * or `Last-Event-ID`, header wins): the missed frames are replayed from the
 * bus's in-flight-turn buffer and live frames follow — no `sync`, no gap, no
 * duplicate. A cursor the buffer can't serve (too old / from before a restart)
 * gets a `sync` with `resync: true` instead; the client refetches history and
 * rebuilds.
 *
 * The connect/replay/flush choreography is the shared `serveResumableStream`
 * (@houston/runtime-client) — one implementation for this route and the host's
 * turn-relay twin.
