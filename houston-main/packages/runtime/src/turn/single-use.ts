 * restarted in place by the kubelet, and that restarted process must refuse to
 * serve until the orchestrator replaces the whole pod (fresh sandbox VM, fresh
 * emptyDir).

 * poolrecycle.go). Requiring HOUSTON_HOME (below) keeps it from silently
 * landing on the container layer, where a restart would not see it.
