/**
 * The domain events a pool turn's durable writes imply, derived from the
 * store-relative keys the sync-back landed. A pod emits these from its
 * handlers; a worker has no event bus, so the written objects ARE the signal.
 * Keys with no client-visible cache map to nothing. Sorted, each type once:
 * the list is a set on the wire.
 *
 * A claimed turn's sync-back scope is its conversation, session, the granted
 * docs, AND every ordinary workspace file (see `claimedTurnIncludes`). Each
 * key is made agent-workspace-relative and run through the SAME classifier the
 * host uses (`agentFileEventType`), so a bash-written `report.pdf` at the
 * workspace root fires `FilesChanged` and a `CLAUDE.md` fires `ContextChanged`
 * — not the old files/-subtree-only special case that left root writes silent.
 * The `cloudrun` layout keeps data under a sibling `dataRel` tree, so its
 * conversation/session keys are mapped explicitly; the `standing` layout has
 * data under `${workspaceRel}/.houston/runtime`, caught by the relative path.
