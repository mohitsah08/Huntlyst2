/**
 * COMPACTION FOR THE CLAUDE AGENT SDK BACKEND — summarize-and-restart, the same
 * shape pi's compaction has, expressed in the only session controls this SDK
 * gives us: one `query()` and the conversationId → session_id mapping.
 *
 * The SDK exposes no compaction control request, so the compaction is performed
 * as a summarization turn INSIDE the conversation's own session (`resume`), and
 * the restart is the mapping being dropped: the next prompt therefore opens a
 * BRAND-NEW SDK session that carries only the summary (the session arms it as
 * the next prompt's prefix). That is the whole of what compaction means here —
 * the model's window holds a summary instead of the full history — and it is
 * what makes the summary text readable at all, which the assistant's durable-fact
 * harvest depends on (session/durable-facts.ts).
 *
 * FAILURE NEVER COSTS HISTORY. The mapping is dropped only after a non-empty
 * summary is in hand; a provider failure, an abort, or an empty answer throws
 * with the session mapping untouched, so the conversation keeps every turn it
 * had. The summarization turn itself runs tool-less and emits nothing on the
 * session's wire stream: it is Houston talking to the model about the
 * conversation, never a turn the user asked for.
