/**
 * Resolve the spawnable `claude` executable for the Claude Agent SDK, but ONLY
 * when the default resolution can't work — inside the Bun-compiled desktop
 * sidecar.
 *
 * On Node (dev, tests, the Docker self-host / engine-pod / per-turn images) the
 * SDK resolves its own native binary via `require.resolve` of the per-platform
 * `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<platform>-<arch>` subpackage, so we return
 * `undefined` and let it — never override a working path.
 *
 * Under `bun build --compile` (the desktop `host-sidecar`) that resolution
 * CANNOT work: the SDK's modules live in Bun's `$bunfs` virtual filesystem, and
 * `require.resolve` can't reach the on-disk subpackage from there (the SDK's own
 * README documents this sharp edge). `scripts/build-host-sidecar.sh` therefore
 * stages the platform `claude` binary NEXT TO the compiled sidecar executable
 * (both are Tauri externalBins → they land in the same bundle directory, e.g.
 * `Contents/MacOS/` on macOS), and this helper points the SDK at that sibling.
 * Shipping it as a sibling file (rather than embedding it in `$bunfs` and
 * extracting to a temp dir at runtime) keeps it a real Mach-O in the bundle that
 * the macOS signing/notarization sweep signs like every other bundled binary.
