/**
 * Build the Claude Agent SDK `HarnessBackend` for the `anthropic` provider.
 *
 * The SDK is an OPTIONAL dependency, so it is imported lazily inside
 * `createSession` — never at module load — and its absence throws a typed
 * `ClaudeBackendUnavailableError` rather than crashing the runtime. The session
 * runs the SDK subprocess against Houston's SHARED credential dir
 * (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` = `claudeLoginConfigDir()`, the same dir the desktop
 * `claude auth login` caches into, so the SDK reads that cached credential and
 * self-refreshes it) and no filesystem settings (`settingSources: []`), so
 * nothing else on the host machine leaks in. `options.env` REPLACES the
 * subprocess environment, so `buildClaudeEnv` builds it from an ALLOWLIST — the
 * few operational vars the SDK needs plus the config dir and the one connected
 * credential — never spreading `process.env` (see `./claude-env`).
 *
 * That shared dir is why a PERSONAL scope with no personal token is REFUSED
 * before the SDK is touched (`assertAnthropicScopeCredential`): on a managed pod
 * the dir holds the TEAM's credential, so a member's turn would authenticate as
 * the team and the SDK would self-refresh the team's refresh-token family in
 * place — a second rotator beside the gateway, and one member's account paying
 * for another's turn (see `./scope-guard`). Team scope (desktop,
 * self-host, every pre-HOU-976 request) and any scope that DOES carry a token are
 * unaffected. A personal scope that DOES carry a token additionally gets its own
 * credential-store dir (`anthropicCredentialStorageDir`), because that token is
 * access-only and can expire MID-TURN — at which point the CLI's own 401 recovery
 * would otherwise re-read that shared dir and finish the turn on the team account.
