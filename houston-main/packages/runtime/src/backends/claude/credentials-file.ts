/**
 * Materialize a pushed Claude subscription OAuth credential as the CLI's own
 * `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/.credentials.json` — the exact file the Claude Agent SDK
 * and `claude auth status` read on Linux (the hosted pod). Written verbatim in
 * the CLI envelope (`{claudeAiOauth:{…}}`). On desktop/self-host the full
 * credential lets the SDK self-refresh in place. A managed serve-mode pod must
 * receive an access-only value: the gateway is the refresh family's single
 * rotator, and materializing its refresh token here would create a second one
 * (Anthropic invalidates the previous holder on every refresh).
 *
 * On a managed pod the file is only an immediate, access-only connected signal
 * at push time. Steady-state, the per-turn served access token rides
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and outranks this file inside the SDK (see
 * backends/claude/read-token.ts). The file cannot be a refresh fallback because
 * the gateway remains the family's only sanctioned rotator.
 *
 * Atomic (tmp + rename) at mode 0600 so a concurrent reader never sees a
 * half-written file and the token is owner-only on disk.
 *
 * HARD SCOPE GUARD (HOU-976). This file is POD-WIDE: one path, shared by every
 * member of a team space. Materializing a MEMBER's credential into it would
 * (1) hand their Anthropic refresh-token family to every other member of the
 * space and (2) create a second rotator for that family — Anthropic invalidates
 * the previous holder on refresh, so the pod's self-refreshing SDK and the
 * gateway would take turns killing each other's token. A personal scope therefore
 * REFUSES, loudly: personal Anthropic on a managed pod is served access-only per
 * turn via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which outranks this file anyway.
