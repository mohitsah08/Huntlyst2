/**
 * THE SHARED LOGIN FILE, PARSED ONCE PER CHANGE — the read side of
 * `<HOUSTON_HOME>/claude-login/.credentials.json` (see shared-login.ts for what
 * that file is).
 *
 * This resolution runs on every credential read of a turn — prompt preparation,
 * the summarizer, each cache lookup — and each one used to open,
 * read and JSON-parse the file again. `statSync` is a single cheap syscall, and
 * identity (inode) + size + mtime together settle whether the bytes can have
 * moved: the writers are atomic tmp+rename (a NEW inode every time), so a
 * same-millisecond rewrite of the same length still invalidates. Only the parse
 * is cached — whether the credential can still authenticate a turn is a question
 * about NOW, re-asked by every caller (shared-login.ts).
