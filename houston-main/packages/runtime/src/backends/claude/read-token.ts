/**
 * Resolve the `anthropic` credential into the `ClaudeToken` the Claude Agent SDK
 * backend runs with. Two stored variants map here:
 *
 *  - The setup-token flow stores the pasted value under `anthropic` as pi's
 *    `api_key` variant (see auth/anthropic-setup-token.ts).
 *  - The connect-once serve path (managed cloud) writes pi's `oauth` variant
 *    with a short-TTL ACCESS token and refresh="" (Gate #2) — the control
 *    plane is the single refresher, the pod never holds the refresh token.
 *
 * Either way the SDK consumes the value through env vars, and WHICH var is
 * selected by the token's prefix: a subscription OAuth/setup token
 * (`sk-ant-oat01…`) rides `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, a console API key
 * (`sk-ant-api03…`) rides `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Mapped here, once, off the SAME
 * prefix list the login validator uses. The env token deliberately outranks
 * whatever `.credentials.json`/Keychain state the config dir carries — a stale
 * materialized file can never shadow a freshly served token.
 *
 * No silent failure: an absent store entry falls through to the rest of the
 * chain (`readAnthropicToken` below) quietly — not connected here is expected —
 * but a STORED value we can't classify (unexpected PiCred variant, or an
 * unrecognized prefix) falls through AND logs the concrete reason, so a
 * bad/corrupt entry surfaces in the logs instead of vanishing.
 *
 * SCOPE (HOU-976): `store.get` resolves the ambient acting identity, so on a
 * shared pod this returns the ACTING member's anthropic token — read inside the
 * turn's async subtree by every caller (conversation-cache, summarize). The
 * shared-login-dir fallback below is TEAM-scope only, mirroring
 * the write refusal in `credentials-file.ts`.

/**
 * The anthropic credential this runtime authenticates the SDK with, resolved in
 * strict precedence order:
 *
 *  1. the STORE entry (`auth.json`), when unexpired — the freshest credential
 *     this agent was served or connected with;
 *  2. the SHARED login dir's `.credentials.json`, when unexpired — one login,
 *     every agent (`./shared-login`). It also OUTRANKS link 1 when it is a
 *     provably later login than the stored copy, which is what lets a reconnect
 *     performed against another runtime reach this one: without that, an
 *     unexpired store entry for the account the user just left would be
 *     preferred for hours, failing every turn on an identity or a token that
 *     reconnect superseded. A superseded store entry is DELETED, not merely
 *     skipped — see below. Where the control plane serves anthropic, the store
 *     entry is the live per-turn credential and this link stays a pure
 *     fallback (`sharedLoginSupersedes`).
 *  3. nothing, which hands the turn to the platform's own config-dir mechanism
 *     inside the SDK (the `.credentials.json` it self-refreshes on Linux, the
 *     dir-scoped keychain item on macOS/Windows).
 *
 * Each link falls through to the next on ANY unusable value — expired, empty,
 * malformed, or absent — so a broken credential can never shadow a working one.
 * A PERSONAL credential scope never reaches the shared dir at all (it is the
 * team's), so a member is never moved onto the team account by any of this.
