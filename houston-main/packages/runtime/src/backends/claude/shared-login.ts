/**
 * THE SHARED LOGIN — `<HOUSTON_HOME>/claude-login/.credentials.json`, the ONE
 * file a Claude login lands in for every agent on this machine or pod.
 *
 * A login pushes its credential to ONE runtime, which persists it in THAT
 * agent's `auth.json`. Every other agent's runtime has no store entry, and on
 * macOS/Windows the platform config-dir mechanism is the OS keychain, which the
 * push never writes — so without this file one login would heal exactly one
 * agent and every other agent would 401 forever. On Linux it is a no-op in
 * effect: the SDK reads the very same file from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.
 *
 * It is also the LOGIN GENERATION every runtime agrees on. A runtime holding an
 * unexpired token of its own would otherwise keep preferring it after the user
 * reconnected somewhere else — running as the account they just left, or 401ing
 * on a token that reconnect superseded, with no way out but an expiry hours
 * away. So a shared login that is demonstrably NEWER than the runtime's own
 * copy wins over it (`sharedLoginSupersedes`), and one that is not is ignored.
 *
 * SCOPE (HOU-976): this file is POD-WIDE, so on a managed pod it holds the
 * TEAM's credential. A PERSONAL scope therefore resolves nothing here — the
 * read-side mirror of `writeClaudeOAuthCredentialFile`'s refusal — and the
 * member's turn surfaces the honest "not connected" card (scope-guard.ts)
 * instead of silently running on, and billing, the team account.

 * the turn on the older pushed token, and the next sync would put the served
 * one back — a ping-pong that ends in `token_revoked` as soon as Anthropic
 * invalidates the previous holder. So on that runtime the SERVED entry wins and
 * the file is only the fallback it was always meant to be.
 *
 * Read from the serve path's own provenance manifest, not from serve mode
 * alone: a managed pod whose gateway does NOT serve anthropic (the desktop
 * pushes the credential there instead) still needs the supersede rule, because

/**
 * Whether the shared login is a LATER login than the runtime's own copy, and so

 *
 * Two conditions, both required:
 *
 *  - it is a DIFFERENT access token. The same token from two sinks is one
 *    login, and preferring either is the same thing.
 *  - it expires LATER. Anthropic issues access tokens with a fixed lifetime, so
 *    a later expiry is a later issuance — the only ordering both sinks record.
 *    A file with no expiry recorded can never prove it is newer and so never
 *    wins; the runtime keeps what it has.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate. Preferring the file whenever the two merely
 * DIFFER would let a stale file (an old login this machine never cleaned up)
 * beat a credential the gateway just served, which is the same bug facing the
 * other way. Only a provable ordering may move a runtime off its own token.
 *
 * And it applies only where the file is the AUTHORITY on the login — the
 * desktop/self-host runtime share. Where the control plane serves anthropic,
 * the store entry is the live credential and the file is a push-time leftover
 * that can never be superseded by anything, so it may not win at all.
