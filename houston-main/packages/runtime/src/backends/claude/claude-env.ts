 * Building the environment for the Claude Agent SDK subprocess.

 * The subprocess runs model-directed Bash on the default hosted-pod profile, so
 * its environment is an exfiltration surface: a prompt-injected agent that runs
 * `printenv` can read anything we hand it. `options.env` REPLACES the child
 * environment (it is not merged onto `process.env`), which is exactly the lever
 * we need — so we build the env from `{}` with an ALLOWLIST of the few
 * operational vars the SDK genuinely needs, never a denylist over `process.env`.
 *
 * Spreading `process.env` and deleting the Anthropic keys (the old approach)
 * still handed the subprocess every host secret: `HOUSTON_SANDBOX_TOKEN`,
 * `HOUSTON_CODE_SANDBOX_TOKEN`, `HOUSTON_TURN_TOKEN`, `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_TOKEN`
 * (config.ts), plus any Composio/GCP credentials. With the sandbox token the
 * agent could call the control plane's `/sandbox/credential` directly and pull
 * the workspace's real provider tokens — defeating the short-TTL Gate-#2 design.

 * the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` alias. We never copy these from the ambient env;

 * inside a memory-limited container (session/child-memory-fence.ts). Left
 * undefined it resolves from the container; null (or no container limit)
 * sets nothing. An ambient prefix is never copied — it is not in the
