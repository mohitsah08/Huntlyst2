 *   Code CLI running next to this runtime (the one sanctioned OAuth client —
 *   the direct PKCE replay is server-blocked since 2026-04): open the authorize
 *   URL, approve, paste back the code the callback page shows. Where no CLI can
 *   run, the token paste flow (an `sk-ant-…` value stored as api_key) remains
 *   the fallback — see auth/anthropic-cli-login.ts.
 * - openai-codex (ChatGPT/Codex): the CLIENT picks. A co-located desktop client
 *   sends `deviceAuth: false` and gets the browser/loopback login — the user
 *   approves in their own browser and the localhost callback finishes it, no
 *   code. A remote webapp (cloud or self-host) sends `deviceAuth: true` and gets
 *   the device-code grant — the user types a one-time code while the runtime
 *   polls. See `codexLoginMethod`.
