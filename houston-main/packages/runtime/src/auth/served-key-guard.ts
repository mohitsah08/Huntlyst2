 * Guard against a served "API key" that can never authenticate (HOU-1107,
 * Sentry HOUSTON-APP-4Y9: 404 failed Gemini turns across 110 users, all
 * managed-cloud).
 *
 * Before the paste-a-key live verification existed, any pasted string was
 * stored as a connected google credential; users pasted OAuth access tokens
 * (`ya29.…`, JWTs) instead of Gemini API keys, and those were captured into
 * the central store as `api_key` rows. The store treats api_key rows as
 * never-expiring and has no google refresher, so it serves the dead token to
 * every pod forever; pi sends it as `x-goog-api-key` and Google answers
 * 401 UNAUTHENTICATED (`ACCESS_TOKEN_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED`) on every turn — with
 * the serve sync re-applying the credential before the next one.
 *
 * Refusing the credential here (serve.ts) turns the burning 401 into the
 * honest state — google reads not-connected, the UI shows the connect card —
 * and the report below deletes the central row so the whole workspace heals,
 * not just this pod. New pastes cannot recreate these rows: verify-api-key.ts
 * live-verifies a google key against the models-list endpoint.

 * keys, the newer `AQ.` auth keys, whatever Google mints next — is served and
 * judged by Google (PRODUCT-1368: an AIza allowlist here refused every new
 * AQ. key and deleted its central row). Scoped to google only: no other
 * provider has this legacy family, and other providers' key shapes are not
