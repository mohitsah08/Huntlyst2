/**
 * Houston's credential store: pi-ai's `CredentialStore` contract over
 * dataDir/auth.json (atomic 0600 writes via auth-file.ts) plus the synchronous
 * `get`/`has`/`set`/`remove`/`reload` surface Houston's turn-time paths need
 * (`providerConnected` runs on the sync turn path, and serve.ts writes auth.json
 * directly then calls `reload()`).
 *
 * pi ≤0.80.6 exported its own `AuthStorage` facade for this; 0.80.8 made
 * credential storage explicitly app-owned ("Login/logout orchestration is
 * app-owned" — pi-ai `CredentialStore`), with `ModelRuntime` doing auth
 * orchestration over whatever store the app provides. This is that store.
 *
 * SCOPE (HOU-976). One pod serves every member of a team space, so the store is
 * per acting identity: every method resolves `currentCredentialScope()` and
 * reads/writes THAT scope's file. `modelRuntime` needs no change — pi calls
 * `credentials.read(providerId)` inside `prepareRequest` on every `stream()`, so
 * the read happens inside the turn's `AsyncLocalStorage` subtree.
 *  - no acting identity → `<dataDir>/auth.json`, the pre-HOU-976 path and bytes
 *    (desktop, self-host, routines, every request without the header);
 *  - `u:<sub>` → `<dataDir>/auth-users/<sha256(sub)[:16]>.json`, same writer.
 * One entry per identity the pod has served — bounded by the space's membership.
 *
 * `modify` is the ONLY write path pi uses (OAuth refresh runs inside it), and
 * it is serialized per (scope, provider) so concurrent requests cannot
 * double-refresh a rotated token. Two members touch two files with two chains;
 * one member's concurrent turns share one file behind one chain. Houston is one
 * process per data dir (host + runtime share the process; the serve path's
 * direct writers live here too), so an in-process chain is the whole
 * mutual-exclusion story — matching auth-file.ts, which has always written
 * auth.json without a cross-process lock.
