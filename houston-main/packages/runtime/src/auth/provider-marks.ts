/**
 * Disk backing for the turn-time provider marks (credential-health.ts): which
 * credential failed authentication, and which one ran out of quota.
 *
 * The marks are DERIVED state, not credential material — each one is a
 * fingerprint (a sha256 of the stored credential) plus an expiry, never a
 * token. They are persisted because a pod restart would otherwise report a
 * dead token as Connected until the next failing turn (PRODUCT-1475), and a
 * routine firing in that window fails with a lie on screen.
 *
 * Persisting "broken" state is only safe because every mark carries the
 * fingerprint of the credential it was recorded against: a re-login, a pasted
 * key, a fresh served token or an endpoint change all move the fingerprint, so
 * a loaded mark auto-heals the moment the credential differs. No out-of-band
 * fix can be wedged off by a stale file.
