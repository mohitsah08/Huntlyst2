 * central credential the host wrote in).
 *
 * Deliberately the stored entry only, NOT pi's resolved auth. Resolved auth
 * ALSO covers an ambient env var (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, …),
 * a CLI `--api-key` override, or a models.json fallback. Those can make a model
 * callable, but none is a connection the user made through Houston, and none is
 * something "Sign out" can clear — so counting them leaves the provider stuck
 * "connected" forever and the logout button does nothing (HOU-557). pi's own
 * `getProviderAuthStatus()` draws the exact same line: a stored credential
 * is `configured: "stored"`, env / override / fallback are not.
 *
 * The stored entry must also be USABLE (`credentialUsable`): a serve-written
 * access-only token that expired with no refresh token is a dead credential,
 * and reporting it connected showed a "Connected" provider whose every turn
 * failed with the reconnect card.
 *
 * ANTHROPIC is the exception: its primary desktop credential is NOT in auth.json
 * at all — the browser login (`claude auth login`) caches it in the shared login
 * dir (Keychain / `.credentials.json`), read only by the `claude` binary. So it
 * counts as connected when EITHER a usable setup-token/served entry is in
 * auth.json OR the shared-dir credential signal reads logged-in
 * (`anthropicCredentialCached`, warmed by `getAuthStatus`). That shared dir is
 * TEAM material, so `anthropicCredentialCached` reports false under a personal
 * scope — a member's "connected" must come from their own credential.
 *
 * Pure over its inputs (store + the cached probe) so the rule stays testable.
