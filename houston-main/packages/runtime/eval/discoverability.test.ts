 *
 * The model half (`pnpm eval:assistant`) answers "does the assistant FIND the
 * operation"; it needs a credential and real tokens, so it stays opt-in. What
 * runs here is the half that would make that eval meaningless if it broke: the
 * operations the fixtures expect must still exist and still be visible, the map
 * the assistant reads must still name them, and the loop that tells it to
 * search before refusing must still be in the prompt. A renamed or newly hidden
 * operation fails the build instead of quietly turning a fixture into an
