/**
 * Heuristic threat scan for uploaded portable agent packages — the TS port
 * of the Rust engine's `portable/scan.rs`, behavior-preserving.
 *
 * V1 is pattern-based. Categories mirror the wire contract the UI renders:
 * each finding shows up next to the offending item with a severity badge
 * and a short reason. An LLM-driven scan is the v2 upgrade — same API.
 *
 * Calibration is intentionally noisy on the side of caution. The UI frames
 * results as "reviewed automatically, here's what stood out", not "Safe ✓".
 * False positives are recoverable (the user can dismiss); false negatives
 * are not.
 */

/**
 * Stays on the wire for protocol v3 compatibility (additive-only). The app
 * renders the localized `portable:import.step1.scanDisclaimer` copy instead,
 * so both must say the same thing.
