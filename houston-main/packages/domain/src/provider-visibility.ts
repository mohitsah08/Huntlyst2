/**
 * The ONE list of pi-ai providers Houston does not surface, and the rule that
 * folds away regional duplicates.
 *
 * Both halves of the product must read the SAME list: the app's catalog builder
 * decides which provider CARDS exist, and the runtime's
 * `request_provider_connection` tool decides which ids an agent may ask the user
 * to connect. When only the catalog knew, the agent could queue a connect card
 * for a provider with no card behind it — the user got "unavailable here" with
 * no Connect button and a composer blocked until they pressed Skip.
 *
 * Hiding is never removal: a hidden id stays runnable on the wire, so a
 * conversation already pinned to one keeps working. It just cannot be connected
 * or picked any more.
 *
 * A leaf whose ONLY import is the sibling leaf `provider-dialect.ts`, itself
 * dependency-free: both are exposed as their own `@houston/domain/*` subpaths
 * so surface code loads them under plain `node --experimental-strip-types`,
 * where a barrel's extensionless internal imports do not resolve.

/**
 * pi providers dropped BEFORE the rename is applied, keyed by pi's CANONICAL

 * - `openai`: pi's direct api-key `openai` provider collides with the
 *   `openai-codex → openai` rename (Houston surfaces the OAuth Codex provider
 *   under `openai`, not the raw API-key one).
 * - Retired cards (2026-07 provider QA): Ant Ling, the Kimi For Coding
 *   subscription (Kimi models surface under Moonshot AI instead), Moonshot AI's
 *   China deployment, and the three regional Xiaomi Token Plans.
 * - Structurally unconnectable (2026-07 provider QA): both Cloudflare providers
 *   need the user's ACCOUNT ID (AI Gateway also a gateway id) baked into the
 *   request URL, so the single-pasted-key connect dialog can never verify or
 *   run them — every attempt dead-ends in "could not verify". Dropped until a
 *   multi-field connect ships (mapped follow-up).
 *   (Azure OpenAI sat here briefly for the same reason; its connect dialog now
 *   collects the resource endpoint alongside the key — PRODUCT-1477.)
