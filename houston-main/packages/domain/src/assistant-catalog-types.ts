 * to describe and dispatch user-facing Houston operations.
 *
 * Declared ONCE, here, because the writer (`scripts/assistant-catalog`) and the
 * reader (`packages/host/src/assistant`) sit in different packages and nothing
 * else makes them agree: two hand-kept copies of a wire shape drift, and the
 * drift surfaces as a catalog the host silently refuses to load — the whole
 * assistant family off, with one log line. Domain is the lowest package both
 * sides already build on, so it is where the shape belongs.
 *
 * Generic over `Schema` for one reason: a parameter's `schema` and an
 * operation's `returns` are arbitrary JSON Schema on the wire. The generator
 * emits them as plain JSON; the host re-reads the same bytes as typebox
 * schemas so it can check arguments against them. Same document, one
 * representation each, rather than a second declaration.
