 * from and where deleting it belongs, so anything working on conversations by
 * id has to be able to tell these apart from a chat the person started.
 *

 * nobody can see the whole of — a reader of one `activity-${id}` template
 * cannot tell whether it is the only one, and a guard written from it would
 * quietly stop covering what it was written for.
