/**
 * The ONE default model per provider, keyed by pi's CANONICAL provider id.
 *
 * The picker, runtime and stored-model migrations share these defaults.
 * A provider-only pin and a newly connected provider select the same model.
 *
 * `Partial` because `ProviderId` is open (any pi-ai id): a provider absent from
 * this table has no catalog default, and readers must handle the missing key
 * (see `provider-model.ts` `defaultModelFor`, and the app catalog's fallback to
 * the provider's first pi model) rather than assume a value. A cross-provider
 * guess is the exact bug this table exists to prevent.
 *
 * A dependency-free LEAF (see `provider-dialect.ts`): exposed as the
 * `@houston/domain/provider-default-models` subpath so the app catalog reads
 * these values instead of restating them.
