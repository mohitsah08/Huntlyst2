// English copy for the landing page. Source of truth for the key tree: es.js
// and pt.js mirror it exactly (same paths, same array lengths), and
// scripts/check-locales.mjs enforces that.
//
// Rules:
// - Keys ending in `Html` may contain markup and are rendered with `| safe`.
//   Everything else is plain text and must be escaped by the template.
// - No em dashes anywhere. Use a comma, a colon, or a sentence break.
// - `{price}` and `{days}` are the only placeholders. Templates substitute them
//   from _data/pricing.js, so a price never gets hardcoded into a translation.
// - Structure (avatar tones, face rosters, logo paths, badges) lives in
//   _data/landing.js. Arrays here zip by index with the arrays there.
// - The `js` subtree is serialized into the page as window.HOUSTON_I18N by
//   _includes/landing/i18n-data.njk. Only put runtime strings there.

// The download gate's generic failure. It is rendered into the markup as the
// form's error line and re-applied at runtime by download-gate-form.js, so it
// lives in one place and is used in both.
