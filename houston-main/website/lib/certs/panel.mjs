/**
 * The glass panel: one translucent slab of the photograph's own navy, inset
 * from the frame so the picture still reads all the way round it, carrying
 * every word of the document.
 *
 * satori has no `backdrop-filter`, so there is no blur to hide behind — the
 * illusion is made of exactly two things and both have to be right:
 *
 *  1. **Alpha low enough that the scene survives.** Under ~0.35 the type loses
 *     the sunrise; over ~0.60 the panel stops being glass and becomes a grey
 *     card stuck on a photo. The tint is also the photograph's own darkest sky
 *     (#040c1e) rather than black, so it darkens the picture instead of
 *     desaturating it.
 *  2. **A lit edge.** A single warm-white hairline is what tells the eye there
 *     is a pane of something there. Without it the panel reads as a smudge.
 *
 * The tint is a gradient, not a flat wash, for one reason: the sunrise sits
 * behind the panel's lower third, exactly where the code and
 * the QR are. Deepening the last stops buys those their contrast while the
 * middle of the panel stays open enough for the glow to come through, which is
 * the whole point of putting the panel on this photograph at all.
