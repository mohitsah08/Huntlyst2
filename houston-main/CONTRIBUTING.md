# Contributing to Houston

Houston is a small team shipping fast. We're glad you want to help, and we have a posted bar so review stays sustainable.

## Before you open a PR

Read this section. If your PR doesn't fit, we'll close it without arguing.

1. **Open an issue first** for anything that isn't a bug fix under ~50 LOC. No surprise PRs for refactors, new tooling, governance, or docs about how to contribute. If we haven't agreed it's worth building, don't build it.
2. **One open PR at a time** per contributor. Open the next one only after the previous merges or closes.
3. **Scratch your own itch.** The PR must fix a bug you hit or add a feature you actually use in Houston. "I thought the repo could use X" isn't a reason. Speculative improvements are work for us, not value.
4. **AI-generated is fine, you reviewing the diff isn't optional.** Use Claude Code, Cursor, whatever. But you read the diff first. If the PR body has to justify why to ship it ("not really an upgrade but…"), don't ship it. PRs that read as raw autonomous-loop output get closed.
5. **No importing external frameworks.** Don't add your own methodology, RFCs, or doctrine to Houston's `docs/`. Link from your repo to ours, not the other way around.
6. **Stacked PRs get one shot.** If the base PR doesn't land, the stack is dead. Don't chain four deep.

If you're unsure whether something fits, open an issue and ask. Cheaper than a closed PR for both of us.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethouston/houston.git
cd houston
pnpm install
cargo check --workspace
```

Before changing architecture or shared behavior, read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), and [`BOUNDARY.md`](BOUNDARY.md). They describe the current host/runtime design, package boundaries, and repository conventions; the code and its tests are the source of truth beyond that.

## Development

```bash
# Run Houston — THE one dev entry point: doctor, then the full stack via
# mprocs (desktop app, web app, host, local cloud).
pnpm dev

# Run just the TypeScript host local profile (the engine)
cd packages/host && pnpm dev

# TypeScript check
pnpm typecheck

# Rust check — the Rust workspace is now just the app/src-tauri Tauri shell
# (the engine is TypeScript; the legacy Rust engine crates were removed)
cargo check --workspace

# Rust tests (Tauri shell)
cargo test --workspace
```

## Structure

- `ui/` — React packages (@houston-ai/*)
- `packages/` — the single TypeScript engine: `runtime` (pi, the agent loop), `host`, `domain`, `protocol`, plus `web`
- `app/` — Houston App: `app/src` React frontend + `app/src-tauri` Rust shell (spawns the host sidecar)

## Pull Requests

1. Confirm your change fits the bar in [Before you open a PR](#before-you-open-a-pr)
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `cargo check --workspace`
5. Open a PR to `main`, fill out the template honestly

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation
- `chore:` — Maintenance
- `refactor:` — Code restructuring

## Code Style

- 200 line file limit (excluding tests)
- No hover-only affordances
- Props over stores in library packages
- No `@/` path aliases in packages
