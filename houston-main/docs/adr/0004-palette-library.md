# Mode and palette are two axes, and imported palettes are derived

Houston ships a palette library: twelve colour sets the user picks from. `data-theme` on `<html>` is the resolved **mode** (`light` | `dark`) and keeps every meaning it has: the `dark:` variant, `color-scheme`, the aurora. `data-palette="<id>"` selects the **set**. Houston Light and Houston Dark are the two defaults, and they are the authored token source itself: they emit no `[data-palette]` block, because they ARE the `:root` / `[data-theme]` blocks. Every generated value in those three blocks is byte-identical to what shipped before the library existed, which `packages/design-tokens/test/zero-diff.test.ts` proves.

The ten imported palettes come from `packages/design-tokens/vendor/omarchy/<theme>/colors.toml` (unmodified Omarchy themes, MIT; attribution in that directory's README). A `colors.toml` is a flat list of 25 hues plus a `mode` line, which is a terminal's vocabulary, not a product's: it has no card tier, no popover, no frosted screen, no contrast guarantee against anything but its own background. So a palette is **derived**, by one table of rules, into the complete `--ht-*` role set (`build/palette.mjs` + `palette-surfaces.mjs` + `palette-text.mjs` + `palette-status.mjs` + `palette-cta.mjs`), and emitted as one `[data-palette="<id>"]` block carrying every variable its mode's base block carries, colours and `--ht-shadow-*` alike. A complete set, never a patch: the block overrides the mode block on the same element, so one missing name would leave a Houston hex stranded in someone else's scheme. `test/palettes.test.ts` asserts set equality both ways.

Houston **authors** five families that no palette gets a say in, and an import inherits them from the Houston set of its own mode, unchanged: `glow.*` (the brand comet), `agent.*` (helmets), `filetype.*` (glyph tints), `person.*` (human avatars) and `flash`, plus every elevation tier. These are identity and effect, not surface, and each is already tuned against the ladder every palette keeps. The status family and the link are inherited for the same reason, and then re-measured on the palette's surfaces (the fourth rule below).

## The derivation table

`P` is the palette's own key. `mix(a, b, t)` is sRGB interpolation, `rgba(c, a)` the colour at that alpha, `composite(f, b)` source-over painting.

| role | light | dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | mix(P.background, P.foreground, 4%) | P.darker_background |
| `background` | P.background | rgba(P.background, 0.55) |
| `pane` | P.background | transparent |
| `input` | mix(bg, fg, 1.5%) | P.background |
| `field` | same as `input` | rgba(line-input, 0.3) |
| `field-hover` | mix(bg, fg, 6%) | rgba(line-input, 0.5) |
| `card` / `card-hover` | rgba(P.background, 0.68 / 0.76) | rgba(P.lighter_background, 0.5 / 0.58) |
| `card-solid`, `tab-active` | P.background | composite(rgba(P.background, 0.55), P.darker_background) |
| `popover`, `dialog` | P.background | P.lighter_background |
| `chip-solid` | P.lighter_background, or mix(bg, fg, 6%) when luminance says it is darker than the background | P.lighter_background |
| `chip-solid-hover` | mix(bg, fg, 10%) | mix(P.lighter_background, fg, 6%) |
| `line` | rgba(P.accent, 0.10) | rgba(fg, 0.10) |
| `line-input` | mix(bg, fg, 12%) | mix(bg, fg, 15%) |
| `hover` · `chip` · `chip-subtle` · `tab-track` · `sidebar-line` · `sidebar-hover` · `sidebar-active` | rgba(fg, 0.06 · 0.035 · 0.035 · 0.06 · 0.06 · 0.06 · 0.10) | rgba(fg, 0.08 · 0.05 · 0.045 · 0.06 · 0.08 · 0.06 · 0.10) |
| `sidebar` | transparent | transparent |
| `ink` · `card-text` · `popover-text` · `chip-text` · `sidebar-text` · `sidebar-hover-text` · `hover-text` | P.foreground | P.foreground |
| `prose-text` | P.foreground | P.bright_foreground |
| `action` · `focus` | P.accent | P.accent |
| `action-text` | whichever of P.background, P.bright_foreground, black, white reads best on `action`; below 4.5:1 is a build error | same |
| `cta` | P.accent | rgba(P.accent, 0.14) |
| `cta-text` | the same measured label as `action-text`, since both sit on the accent | P.bright_foreground, nudged toward white until it clears 4.5:1 on `cta` composited over `input` and over `base` |
| `cta-hover` | mix(P.accent, fg, 12%) | rgba(P.accent, 0.22) |
| `cta-rim` · `cta-rim-hover` | transparent | rgba(P.accent, 0.35) · rgba(P.accent, 0.50) |
| `bubble` / `bubble-text` | P.foreground / P.background | rgba(fg, 0.045) / P.bright_foreground |
| `bubble-chip` / `bubble-chip-text` | rgba(P.background, 0.20) / P.background | rgba(fg, 0.10) / P.foreground |
| `danger` · `success` · `warning` · `danger-fill` · `danger-ring` · `highlight` | inherited from Houston (same mode) | same |
| `danger-text` · `success-text` · `warning-text` | the first tone on the SIDE Houston's own label sits (P.background, P.foreground, P.bright_foreground, then white or black) that clears 3:1 on the inherited fill; a side where nothing clears it flips, and the build notes that | same |
| `ink-muted` | P.muted, nudged (below) | same |
| `link` · `danger-ink` · `success-ink` · `warning-ink` · `highlight-text` | inherited from Houston (same mode), nudged on the palette's own surfaces (below) | same |

The alpha constants are Houston's own, per mode, with the palette's foreground as the colour: a wash is ink laid thinly, so it re-tints itself when the surface moves. Houston's light `hover`, `field-hover` and `chip-solid` ship as opaque grays (`#efefef` is ink at ~6% on white), so the light ladder spends the same 6% as an explicit mix and those tiers stay opaque.

Four rules deserve their reason. **Inherited status**: `danger`, `success`, `warning`, `highlight`, the destructive pair, their labels, their inks and `link` are Houston's own, taken from the set of the same mode. A palette's red, green and yellow are what a terminal prints error text in, not a product's tuned danger, success and warning, and a palette can have none of them: `white`'s three hues are `#2a2a2a`, `#3a3a3a` and `#4a4a4a`, and its blue is `#1a1a1a`, so a derived set turned "Delete forever" into a pill indistinguishable from a normal button and a resting link into plain black text. Status is SEMANTICS, not surface, exactly like the agent helmets and the file-type tints above, and a user who picks a colour scheme is not asking for a different meaning of danger. What the palette still decides is how those hues are worn on ITS surfaces: each label is re-picked on its fill in the palette's own vocabulary, and every role worn as text climbs the palette's own ladder below. The **accent CTA**: an import is a colour identity, and the accent is the one hue its author chose to stand for it, so the filled CTA, the action colour and the focus ring wear it, each in the grammar of the palette's own mode. In light the button is a solid accent pill, because a translucent fill on a light surface reads as a disabled control; the accent is tuned for a terminal prompt rather than for a button, so that pill's label is measured rather than assumed, from the same four candidates a status fill uses, and a palette whose best label misses 4.5:1 is a build error. In dark the button keeps Houston dark's frost grammar, the glass every dark surface is built from, tinted with the accent: fill, hover, rim and hover rim are the accent at 14%, 22%, 35% and 50%, denser than Houston's own white frost because a hue carries less light than white at the same alpha. A frost pill is translucent, so what is under it is part of its colour, and its label is measured on the pill over both surfaces a primary button sits on: the palette's bright foreground, stepped toward white until it clears 4.5:1 on the pill over `input` and over `base`. Houston's own two sets keep their authored buttons, an ink solid in light and a white frost in dark, because near-monochrome content with brand-coloured chrome IS the Houston identity, and they never pass through this table: they are the base blocks. The **screen-tone rule**: a dark `card-solid` is the frosted screen's own composited tone, so a board card reads as the screen showing through its column tray rather than a slab laid on it. And the **light chip fallback**: Omarchy's `lighter_background` means "one step in the dark direction", so in a light palette it is usually the *darker* neighbour, and `white` sets it to `#c0c0c0`, far too heavy for a chip. When luminance says it sits below the background, the chip falls back to Houston's own recess. All five light palettes take that fallback today; the build prints one note per palette when they do.

## Contrast floors

Every hue that lands here was tuned somewhere else: an imported accent for a terminal, where text sits on one flat background, and an inherited status ink for Houston's own canvas. Houston sets the same hue on four rows (the screen, a field, a chip row and a recessed row) and on a chip washed with a hue behind it. So the six roles worn AS TEXT are stepped toward the palette's own ink in 2% mixes until they clear their floor on every one of those composites: `link`, `danger-ink`, `success-ink`, `warning-ink` and `highlight-text` at 4.5:1, `ink-muted` at 3:1.

A wash is not a neutral surface: it tints the backdrop toward the very text sitting on it, so it is the real floor. The status inks are measured on their own hue at 10% and 15% over each row (`bg-danger/10`, `bg-success/15`), `highlight-text` on the `highlight` wash over each row, and `link` on a 10% wash of **itself** over each row, because the chat link chip is `text-link` on `bg-link/10` — one token that is both the ink and its own backdrop, so each rung of its ladder re-composites the wash it is being measured against. Every rung is snapped to eight-bit hex before it is measured, since the hex is what the CSS ships and a float mix can clear the floor by hundredths that rounding takes back.

Moving toward ink always raises contrast, since ink is the darkest thing in a light palette and the brightest in a dark one, so the ladder is monotone and its last rung is ink itself. A palette whose own ink misses the floor is a build error. `test/palettes.test.ts` re-measures every guarded composite from the generated CSS, for all ten imports.

## A pinned mode resolves the Houston set

`[data-theme="light"]` on a subtree (the first-run flow's calm setup canvas, the sign-in card) resolves the **Houston** light set, not the user's chosen light palette. That is the design, and it follows from where the declarations sit: the palette block is on `<html>`, the pin is on a descendant, and a declaration on the element itself wins. A pinned subtree is chrome that has one authored look; it defies the app theme on purpose, and a palette is the user's choice of app theme.

## Adding a palette

1. Drop `<theme>/colors.toml` into `packages/design-tokens/vendor/omarchy/` (the README there has the fetch command) and list the theme in its table.
2. Add one line to `PALETTE_ORDER` in `build/omarchy.mjs`: the id, the display name, and the mode group. The file's own `mode` line must agree, or the build fails.
3. `pnpm --filter @houston/design-tokens build && pnpm --filter @houston/design-tokens test`. The CSS block, the `palettes` export and the `PaletteId` union all follow; the tests cover the new palette by looping the export. Read the build's notes for the nudges and fallbacks it applied.

A palette needing a hand-written value is a signal the table is wrong, not that the palette is special: fix the rule.

## Considered Options

- **A palette as a patch** (redeclaring only the dozen variables that "matter"): smaller CSS, but every unpatched role keeps a Houston hex, and which roles those are drifts silently with every token added. Rejected: a set is either complete or wrong.
- **Authoring all twelve sets by hand** as token JSON: full control per palette, at the cost of twelve files to re-tune on every token added and no contrast guarantee. Rejected: the table is the product decision, and a hand-authored set hides it.
- **A third axis for the palette's own "mode"** (letting a light palette be worn in dark mode): meaningless. A palette's mode is a property of its hexes, so it decides which structure it wears; the picker groups by it rather than offering the cross product.
