/**
 * The rail has three tiers, and they answer three different questions.
 *
 * **Foundations** is the design system BEFORE any component: the palette, the
 * effects painted on the canvas. It sits at the top because it is what every
 * page below is an application of, and its first page is where the showcase
 * opens.
 *
 * **Primitives** is the `@houston-ai/*` inventory by kind — what a button is,
 * what an overlay is. Catalog lives here too: a catalog row is a generic list
 * primitive, not a screen of the product.
 *
 * **Product areas** is the same inventory by *where the user meets it*, named
 * for the app's own surfaces (`shell:sidebar.*`) and ordered as the rail orders
 * them. A designer reviewing "the Routines screen" starts here.
 *
 * A specimen files itself under one group by name; `tests/registry.test.ts`
 * fails the build on a group that is not declared below, so a typo can never
 * quietly strand a page.
