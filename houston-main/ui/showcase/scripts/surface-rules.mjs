/**
 * Where a file lives → what the user calls that place.
 *
 * The navigation labels are the product's own words: they come from
 * `app/src/locales/en/shell.json` → `sidebar` (Houston, AI Models,
 * Integrations, Your AI Employees, Academy, Settings), built by
 * `app/src/components/shell/sidebar-nav-sections.tsx` and drawn by
 * `app/src/components/shell/sidebar-chrome.tsx`.
 *
 * The remaining per-area labels below (Activity, Chat, Routines, Skills,
 * Integrations, Files, Archived, Permissions, Agent Settings) are HISTORICAL
 * names: they were the per-agent tab strip, which was deleted along with
 * `agents:tabLabels.*` and `app/src/agents/standard-tabs.ts`. Those surfaces
 * live on as employee sections (Mission Control / Routines / Files) and as
 * sections of the agent settings page (job description, memory, people, apps,
 * AI models, skills). The names are kept because they are still how the team talks about
 * these component families, and a "Used in" chip is a wayfinding hint, not a
 * route. Rename a group only if the product's own word for it changes.
 *
 * Keys are repo-relative path prefixes and the **longest** match wins, so a
 * broad folder rule and the narrow exceptions inside it sit side by side in any
 * order. Folder keys end in `/`; a few keys are file-name prefixes, because
 * `app/src/components/` and `app/src/components/{shell,agent}/` each hold
 * several product areas at once.
