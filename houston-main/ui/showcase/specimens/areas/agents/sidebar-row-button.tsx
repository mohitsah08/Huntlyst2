        note="A fixed 28px box, a 20px glyph column, a truncating label, an optional trailing slot inside the button and an optional affordance beside it. The pill is INSET 6px from each edge and rounded on the same radius an employee screen's section lozenges wear, so it reads as a row floating on the rail rather than as a bar cut across it. It is painted on a layer of its own, behind the content, which is what lets it be inset without dragging the glyph column with it: hierarchy stays the indent INSIDE a full-width button, so the pills line up in one clean column instead of stepping in and out with their contents. Click anything — the highlight is live."

        note="Two indents and only two. `block` sits at the rail's edge and is medium; `child` hangs 12px to its right and is regular. Both are 13px. Weight states the DEPTH, never the state, so selecting a row cannot re-measure its label and shift where a long name truncates."

      <SpecimenSection
        title="States"
        note="Rest, hover, focus and active, and a row can be active AND a disclosure at once: that is a collapsed team standing in for the destination row it is hiding, so the rail never goes dark on the question of where you are. Hover is `bg-sidebar-hover` (6%) against the pill's `bg-sidebar-active` (10%): a ratio, so the row under the cursor is unmistakable without ever passing for the selected one. Focus rides the same inset layer, so the ring traces the pill instead of a rectangle wider than the fill it is outlining."

Filled, because a solid triangle says 'this is closed' where an outline chevron says 'there is more over there'. Beside the words rather than at the row's far edge, because a mark a whole gap away reads as a separate control instead of as the label's own state. There is no placement option to get wrong."
