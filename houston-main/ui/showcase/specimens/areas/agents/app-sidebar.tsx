A team row is one hit target (glyph, name, triangle and rollup badge together) and its glyph is monochrome on purpose: the identity colour belongs to the agent avatars."

          title="States"
          note="Selection is one paint for every kind of row: a team header and an agent row wear the same pill, so “where am I” reads the same whichever is open. Folding a team hides everything under it — its header keeps the pill and picks up a rollup badge, so the rail never goes dark on the question. Rows carry no menu at all: a team's name and mark are changed in the host's own dialog, and an agent is renamed, recoloured, moved and deleted on its focused agent screen, so the rail keeps one door onto each and its full width for names."
