        note="One button, not three. The glyph, the name and the triangle are a single hit target, so a keyboard user reaches the disclosure in one stop and a screen reader is told what the row folds. The triangle is an indicator, not a control: what activating the row does is the host's rule, so a triangle claiming to be the fold button would promise an outcome it does not own. The row wears the same 28px box and the same pill as the member rows under it, so a team reads as the head of its ladder rather than as chrome above one — its glyph simply sits 12px to their left."

The hole that leaves is answered by the header itself: it wears the selected pill whenever the block owns the open view, and its trailing slot rolls up what the hidden rows were signalling, so folding a team never means losing sight of it. A team's name and mark are changed in the host's own dialog, never on this row — the header has exactly two states, folded and open."
