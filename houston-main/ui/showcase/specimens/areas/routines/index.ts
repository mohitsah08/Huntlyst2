/**
 * The **Routines** area (`@houston-ai/routines`): an agent's scheduled and
 * event-triggered work — the list pane, the rows it is built from, the schedule
 * builder behind every cron, the account-wide timezone, and the badge that says
 * whether an event routine can actually fire.
 *
 * One file per component (`<component>.tsx`, exporting
 * `export const specimen: Specimen` with `group: "Routines"` alongside
 * `export const sources: string[]`), listed below outside-in: the whole pane
 * first, then the rows it renders, then the controls each row composes.
 * `sample.ts` holds the four routines every page renders against, so a row
 * reviewed alone is the same row reviewed inside the list.
 *
 * Not documented here: the pure helpers the package also exports
 * (`cronSummary`, `presetSummary`, `nextFire`, `describeNextFire`, `interp`,
 * the `triggerBadgeState` view helpers) and the `DEFAULT_*` label objects. They
 * paint no pixel of their own — `ui/routines/tests` covers them.
