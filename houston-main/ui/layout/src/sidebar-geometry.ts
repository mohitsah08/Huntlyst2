/**
 * The rail's row anatomy, defined ONCE.
 *
 * EVERY interactive line in the sidebar's list is the same row: each group's
 * header, and each person. A person row (see {@link sidebarPersonRow}) is the
 * one deliberate variation: a bigger portrait and a second line, spaced like a
 * message list. Rows differ only in what they point at and how far their
 * glyph is indented. If any of them drifts in height, indent, glyph column or
 * type size, the rail stops reading as one list and starts reading as several
 * stacked ones. So every value lives here and nowhere else, and
 * {@link SidebarRowButton} is the only component that spends them.
 *
 * Six invariants keep every row on the same ladder:
 *
 * 1. **Height is FIXED per anatomy** (`h-7`, 28px; a person row `h-16`, 64px).
 *    No hover, active, focus, badge or missing-role state may change it — a
 *    rail that reflows under the cursor is the single most obvious tell of a
 *    hand-built list.
 * 2. **The paint is a LAYER, the content sits on top of it.** Hover and active
 *    are drawn on the row's own `::before` — an inset, rounded pill (see
 *    {@link sidebarRowFill}) — never on the element that carries the geometry.
 *    That split is the whole reason the pill can be inset without dragging the
 *    glyph column 6px to the right with it: the indent is spent inside a
 *    full-width button that the paint knows nothing about, so the pills form
 *    one clean column and hierarchy stays a matter of indent, never of a ragged
 *    left edge.
 * 3. **Colour is never pinned on the glyph.** A row's icon inherits its label's
 *    colour, so an active row brightens as one object rather than as a label
 *    with a stale grey mark beside it.
 * 4. **ONE weight for the rail's lines.** Every glyph row is set at 510, the
 *    notch past
 *    medium that Linear's rails use. Weight is therefore never a variable: not
 *    of depth, not of state, so nothing re-measures or reflows on click, and
 *    hierarchy is carried entirely by indent and colour. See
 *    `font-weight-510` in `@houston-ai/core`'s globals for why 510 is spelled
 *    the way it is. A person row's NAME is the exception: it is set semibold
 *    at the same 13px, because it names someone rather than somewhere.
 * 5. **One type size for the rows.** Every row is 13px; a person row's second
 *    line is the one 12px exception. See {@link sidebarRowType}.
 * 6. **One horizontal inset for every run of rows.** See
 *    {@link sidebarRailInset}.
