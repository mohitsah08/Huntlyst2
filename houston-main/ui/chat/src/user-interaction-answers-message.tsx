/**
 * Read-only card rendered in place of a plain user_message body when the user
 * finished an `ask_user` interaction sequence. Reads as a quiet receipt: each
 * answered question is a small muted label with the user's answer directly
 * below, and successive pairs are separated by a hairline divider for an even
 * rhythm (a lone pair simply reads as a deliberate compact receipt, no
 * divider). A non-question line (a connected app, a signin confirmation) shows
 * as a single value line. Sits in the right column of the conversation where
 * user bubbles live, styled quieter than the interaction card. Content is
 * pass-through data, so no i18n labels are needed.
