/**
 * Tool-name → human label resolution. Pure (no React imports) so the exact
 * same verb that a `ToolBlock` row shows ("Reading file", "Running command")
 * can also drive the process-block header, and so it can be unit-tested under
 * `node:test` without a DOM.
 *
 * These labels are intentionally English: `ui/` stays i18n-agnostic, and the
 * app does not pass `toolLabels`, so tool verbs read in English in every
 * locale (matching how the in-pane tool rows have always rendered).
