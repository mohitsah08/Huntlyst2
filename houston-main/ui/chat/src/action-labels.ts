// labels here, from one verb table family.
//
// Which words the TOOLKIT owns is not decided here: it is the shared
// `actionWordsWithoutToolkit` (`@houston-ai/core`), the same reading the
// workflow-step chip uses (`@houston-ai/skills`, `humanizeIntegrationAction`),
// so a multi-word toolkit spelled `googlemaps` against `GOOGLE_MAPS_SEARCH`
// cannot be stripped on one surface and left standing on the other. Imported
// by deep path because the core barrel is the React component library and this
// module has to stay loadable under `node --test`.

// as-is, never conjugated — a wrong gerund reads worse than the plain word.
