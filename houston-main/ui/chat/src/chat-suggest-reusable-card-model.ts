// Shared labels + a pure presentation helper for ChatSuggestReusableCard.
// DOM-free (mirroring chat-plan-ready-card-model.ts) so the node:test suite can
// drive the save-label decision without a DOM runner; the .tsx component maps
// the resolved label to a row verbatim (icons are internal to the component).
//
// This card is simpler than the plan-ready card: it has exactly TWO actions
// (Save, Not now), not three, and the two rows have no per-row description. So
// there is no generic action-list resolver here (that would be over-engineering
// for two fixed rows). The one branch that isn't a plain prop is the save
// label, which depends on `reusableKind` — that is the single pure helper below.

/** English defaults live in the app; consumers pass `t()` results in. This
 *  constant is the fallback for apps that don't localize the card yet. */
