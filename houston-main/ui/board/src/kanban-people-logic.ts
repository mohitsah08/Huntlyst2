 * Right gutter the card body reserves for the bottom-right face stack, as a

 * `.tc-desc { padding-right: 44px }`: without it the last line of the
 * description runs underneath the faces.
 *
 * Sized to the stack it has to clear, rounded UP to the sanctioned spacing
 * scale (DESIGN.md §4), rather than capped: an opaque face hides the text under
 * it just as thoroughly as a translucent one garbled it, so "the tail of the
 * sentence is gone" is not an acceptable trade for a wider description. The
 * stack is `18px` circles overlapped by `6px`, each carrying a `2px` ring that
 * bleeds outward, so N circles paint `N * 12 + 10` px; each tier is the first
 * scale step at or above that (22->24, 34->40, 46->48, 58->64, 70->80,
 * 82->96) — rounding up only ever adds clearance. N never exceeds
 * {@link CARD_PEOPLE_MAX} + 1 (the faces plus the "+N" chip).
 *
 * Returns `""` for an unattributed card so its body class list — and therefore
 * a single-player board — stays byte-identical.
