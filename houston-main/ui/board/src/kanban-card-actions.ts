 *  control cluster: four glyphs sitting side by side at different weights read
 *  as a rendering bug. The light tint is deliberate — the row is secondary to
 *  the mission's own content and must recede until the card is being worked
 *  with; it rises to full strength on hover, where the affordance is being
 *  used. The neutral hover is the row's default too; an action with a semantic
 *  outcome (approve → success, delete → danger) appends its own `hover:` pair,
 *  which tailwind-merge lets win. */
