 * tall frame, for a step that is a catalog to scan.

 * larger than the `sm` edge it starts at, so it keeps that gutter inside its
 * own `min()`: the sheet reaches its full width only once the viewport can
 * pay for cap and gutter together (704px), never edge to edge before that.
 *
 * Neither frame carries a width or height TRANSITION, deliberately: the size
 * changes as the flow walks, and animating a surface's box is layout animation
 * — DESIGN.md allows transform and opacity alone. The step inside crossfades
 * instead, which is the change the eye should follow anyway.
 *
 * `compact` takes the dialog's own `p-6` and is the confirm dialog exactly:
 * height from the content, and the SHEET is the only thing that may ever
 * scroll — past the cap it scrolls as one surface, title and all. `wide` pays
 * its padding per part, because its body is the one scrolling element between
 * a fixed header and a pinned bar.
