/**
 * Reveal — animated wrapper for a schedule field that conditionally appears.
 * `layout` lets the surrounding fields slide to their new positions as this one
 * mounts/unmounts, so the builder card grows and shrinks smoothly instead of
 * snapping. Wrap each conditional field in an `<AnimatePresence>`. Values per
 * design-system.md.
