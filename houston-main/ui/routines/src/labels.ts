/**
 * Localization labels for the Routines UI.
 *
 * `ui/` stays i18n-agnostic per the library boundary: components and the pure
 * schedule/time formatters take optional `labels` (with English defaults) and a
 * `locale`, and the app passes `t()` results in. Static strings are plain; the
 * dynamic ones carry `{token}` placeholders filled by `interp()`.
 *
 * Why `{token}` (single brace) and not i18next's `{{token}}`: the app sources
 * these templates with `t(key, { returnObjects: true })` WITHOUT interpolation
 * values (the numbers/times are computed here in `ui/`, not at the call site).
 * Double-brace tokens would be eaten by i18next; single-brace ones survive and
 * are filled here. The locale validator only checks `{{ }}` parity, so `{token}`
 * is invisible to it — keep the tokens identical across en/es/pt by hand.
 *
 * Day names, month names, AM/PM and date order come from `Intl.*Format(locale)`,
 * so they localize without per-language strings.
 *
 * The English default values live in `./labels-default` (re-exported below) to
 * keep this file focused on the type contracts.
