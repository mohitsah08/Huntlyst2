/**
 * RoutinesGrid — the Routines list surface. This file owns the props contract
 * and the top-level gating (loading spinner, empty state) and delegates the
 * populated view to RoutinesGridList, keeping each file under the size cap.
 *
 * The surface is chat-first: routines are created and changed by asking the agent,
 * so the grid itself never edits a routine. This is the LEFT pane of the
 * Scheduled split — a persistent, selectable list beside the selected task's
 * chat. A row click opens (selects) that routine's chat; the grid otherwise
 * only enables/disables, runs/stops, and deletes routines, plus lists
 * in-construction draft chats. The pane header (title + create) and the
 * timezone footer are app-owned chrome around this list.
