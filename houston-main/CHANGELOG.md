# Changelog

All notable changes to Houston will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Houston ships as a bundle: the **app** follows the top-level semver
(`0.3.x`), the **engine** has its own crate-level semver (`0.4.x`)
paired with a `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (currently `1`). Entries below that
only touch the engine note the engine crate version in parentheses.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`examples/` directory** — reference consumers of `houston-engine`
  for third-party devs building custom frontends. First entry:
  `examples/smartbooks/` — a bookkeeping app with its own brand, no
  `@houston-ai/*` UI deps, ~400 lines TSX, end-to-end demo of the
  soft-workflow pattern (drop PDF → live table → ask to add a column
  → agent edits Python → applies to all clients)
- **pptx workspace glob** — `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now includes
  `examples/*` so SmartBooks (and future examples) resolve
  `@houston-ai/engine-client` as a workspace dependency
- **Knowledge-base entry on custom-frontend gotchas** — documented in
  the SmartBooks README: always call `startAgentWatcher` on mount, WS
  subscribe before firing sessions, feed-item streaming reducer, use
  `/v1/shell` with `open`/`xdg-open` for binary files until a
  first-class binary-read route lands
- **System-prompt user-voice rules** — every agent now follows explicit
  rules about how it talks to the user: no file/JSON/path/CLI/schema
  mentions, no narration of how things are done, only surface missing
  info or the result, short sentences in plain language. Lives in
  `app/src-tauri/src/houston_prompt.rs::HOUSTON_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
- **Store-package migrations (`.migrations.json`).** Bundled packages
  can now declare per-version rename steps so existing users converge
  to new slugs on update instead of accumulating old-and-new copies
  in their picker. Engine applies renames per-workspace on the next
  sync, preserving each user's edited skill body content. Tracked via
  a new `.houston/bundled-package.json` marker per workspace agent.
  See `store/README.md` for the format.

### Changed
- **The engine client is a real package, and the alias is gone.**
  `@houston-ai/engine-client` was a name four configs redirected to
  `packages/web/src/engine-adapter` — and that plain Node resolved to a
  different module entirely. The adapter is now the workspace package
  `@houston/engine-adapter` (`packages/engine-adapter`), which `app` and
  `packages/web` both depend on; pnpm's symlink is the only resolution, so
  vite, tsgo, node, biome and esbuild agree on which package the specifier
  names, with no configuration. (Plain Node loads the adapter's subpaths,
  not its barrel — `src/index.ts` imports its siblings extensionless, as
  nearly every `@houston/*` barrel does, which is why `app/src` re-exports
  the error predicates by subpath.) The vite aliases, the two tsconfig
  `paths` entries, `scripts/desktop-native/` and its assertion in
  `check-desktop-native.mjs` are deleted.
  The half of the old package that shipped no client — the v3 wire shapes, the
  local-model-bridge port, the `Retry-After` parser — is now
  `@houston/wire-types` (`packages/wire-types`), with no I/O left in it: its
  one fetching module, `store-catalog.ts`, moved into the adapter. The catalog
  generator that lived there is repo tooling and moved to
  `scripts/assistant-catalog/`, its documents to `docs/assistant/`; both its
  specs and the adapter's now run in CI, where neither did before.
  `CHANGELOG.md` and `convergence/**` keep the old names on purpose — they
  record what was true then.
- The in-app Agent Store now renders the same Home, agent detail, and creator
  profile screens as the public website, including shared filtering and
  loading, empty, and retry states.
- README points devs at `examples/smartbooks/` as the template for
  building on top of `houston-engine`
- **Bundled Legal agent — full skill rewrite (v0.2.0).** All 40 Actions
  renamed and rewritten so a non-technical founder can read the picker
  cards and instantly know what each one does. Slugs replaced with
  plain-English phrases ("Is this name free?", "Answer a customer data
  request", "Calculate my Delaware franchise tax"). Descriptions and
  form labels rewritten from internal jargon to founder voice. Internal
  procedures unchanged.
- **`knowledge-base/skills.md` — naming rules section added.** Slugs
  must humanize cleanly; no insider acronyms; no `display_name`
  override; descriptions and form labels are user-facing copy.

### Fixed
- **Windows: black-screen + small-loading-window crash loop on first
  launch (engine 0.4.11).** The bundled PortableGit `.7z.exe` was
  previously extracted by invoking the SFX as a subprocess. Igor
  Pavlov's GUI SFX module always renders its own progress dialog
  (this was the "small loading window" users reported), and the
  blocking extraction sat between engine bind and `axum::serve`. On
  every launch the engine missed Tauri's 5s `/v1/health` deadline,
  the supervisor `expect()`-panicked the main window closed, the
  SFX was killed mid-extract, no marker file was written, and the
  next launch produced the same sequence. Houston now extracts the
  embedded 7z archive in-process via `sevenz-rust2` (skipping the
  PE stub), runs the provisioning as a fire-and-forget background
  task so engine HTTP comes up immediately, and uses a temp-dir +
  atomic-rename so a partial extraction never poisons the install.
  Tauri's `wait_until_healthy` budget also bumped from 5s to 30s as
  defense-in-depth against other slow first-boot paths
  (`engine/houston-engine-core/src/git_bash.rs`,
  `engine/houston-engine-server/src/main.rs`,
  `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-21 (engine 0.4.0)

### Added
- **Standalone `houston-engine` binary** (engine 0.4.0, protocol v1) —
  the axum HTTP + WebSocket server every client now speaks. Ships as
  a Tauri sidecar for the desktop app AND as a self-contained process
  for VPS deployments. Same binary either way.
- **`houston-engine-server` crate** with ~80 REST endpoints across 17
  route modules (workspaces, agents CRUD, sessions, agent data +
  files, routines + scheduler, skills, store, composio, sync,
  worktrees, shell, attachments, preferences, providers, agent-
  configs, conversations, watcher). One integration-test file per
  module under `engine/houston-engine-server/tests/`.
- **`houston-engine-core` crate** — transport-neutral domain logic
  (workspaces, agents, sessions, routines, store, sync, worktree,
  provider, attachments, preferences, conversations, skills,
  agent-configs) relocated out of the Tauri adapter. Now usable from
  REST handlers, CLI tools, and tests.
- **`houston-engine-protocol` crate** — wire types (REST DTOs, WS
  envelope, error codes, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`). Source of truth for
  `ui/engine-client/src/types.ts`.
- **`@houston-ai/engine-client`** TypeScript SDK — single npm package
  with `HoustonClient` + `EngineWebSocket`. ~1200 lines. The one
  dependency third-party devs install to build a custom frontend.
- **Houston Always On** — VPS self-host shipping today. Multi-stage
  Dockerfile (~50 MB runtime), `docker-compose.yml`, systemd unit
  template, README with TLS proxy examples.
- **Engine supervisor** (`app/src-tauri/src/engine_supervisor.rs`) —
  spawns the binary, parses the `HOUSTON_ENGINE_LISTENING` banner
  for `{port, token}`, injects `window.__HOUSTON_ENGINE__` into the
  webview, exponential backoff restart on crash, cross-platform
  parent-death detection via stdin EOF watchdog.
- **File watcher subscription** — `/v1/watcher/start` starts a
  `notify` watcher on an agent folder so writes the CLI agent makes
  directly (bypassing the engine) still emit `FilesChanged` events
  over the WS.

### Changed
- **All domain Tauri IPC commands deleted** — `app/src-tauri/` keeps
  only 7 OS-native commands (pick directory, open URL, reveal file,
  open terminal, check claude CLI). Everything else flows through
  the engine over HTTP/WS.
- **`app/houston-tauri/` renamed from adapter to thin glue layer** —
  event sink bridge, tray UI, path helpers, shared state. No more
  domain logic.
- **Engine is now a subprocess, not in-process** — desktop app
  spawns `houston-engine` on startup via Tauri `externalBin`, the
  webview talks to it at `127.0.0.1:<random>` with a bearer token
  from `~/.houston/engine.json`.

### Fixed
- Orphan engine processes holding ports after app force-quit — stdin
  EOF watchdog + `setpgid` process group kill on supervisor drop
- `Child::wait()` tripping the parent-death watchdog — supervisor
  now takes `ChildStdin` out of `Child` before the first wait
- CORS preflight failures in WKWebView (`PUT`/`PATCH` returning "Load
  failed") — switched to fully permissive CORS (safe because bearer
  tokens aren't CORS credentials)

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Composio MCP integration** — agent apps marketplace via
  `/v1/composio/*`. OAuth, app catalog, per-agent connections.
- **Workspace templates** — import a whole workspace (multi-agent)
  from a GitHub repo via `POST /v1/workspaces/install-from-github`
- **GitHub agent import** — single-agent one-click install via
  `POST /v1/agents/install-from-github`
- **Routines + scheduler** — cron-style recurring prompts per agent.
  `/v1/routines`, `/v1/routine-runs`, `/v1/routines/scheduler/*`
- **Houston Mobile** — Capacitor + React PWA companion, deploys to
  Cloudflare Pages. Pairs with the desktop via the
  `desktop-mobile-bridge/` relay Durable Object.
- **Auto-updater** — Tauri plugin, signed update artifacts pointed
  at GitHub Releases, in-app update banner + restart

### Changed
- Renamed "Space" back to "Workspace" (0.2.0 rename reverted —
  workspace is the industry-standard term)
- `.houston/<type>/<type>.json` typed layout (was flat
  `.houston/<type>.md` in 0.1.0) with embedded JSON Schemas
- Skills convention aligned with Claude Code: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  with a symlink to `.claude/skills/<name>`

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- Single rolling `claude_session_id` per conversation — restart-safe
  chat history via `--resume`
- Per-agent file watcher + event-driven query invalidation
  (TanStack Query keys re-fetched on `FilesChanged`)
- Drafts persistence for in-flight message composition
- Sentry + Aptabase analytics wired to env vars (opt-in)

### Changed
- Moved Rust domain logic from `app/houston-tauri/src/commands/` into
  standalone crates (`houston-agent-files`,
  `houston-agents-conversations`, `houston-terminal-manager`, …) —
  groundwork for the engine split in 0.3.2
- Made all `.houston/` writes atomic (temp + rename) with
  `safe_relative` path-traversal guards

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Spaces** — top-level organizational container (replaces "Organization"). Space switcher in sidebar, CRUD commands in Rust, `useSpaceStore` in frontend
- **Dashboard view** — grid overview of all workspaces in current space
- **Connections view** — space-scoped channel and service management
- **Per-task Claude sessions** — each kanban card is a Claude conversation with its own session and chat history
- **Kanban column `onAdd` button** — "+" button in column headers for creating tasks directly from the board
- **New conversation panel** — dedicated panel for starting conversations on tasks
- **ChatSidebar** — progress tracking sidebar showing step checklist + channels list, moved to `@houston-ai/chat`
- **ProgressPanel** — step-by-step agent progress checklist alongside chat
- **`.houston/prompts/` convention** — editable system prompt components (`system.md`, `self-improvement.md`)
- **Context tab** — editable CLAUDE.md + prompt files in the workspace
- **Welcome screen** — first-launch onboarding to create initial space

### Changed
- Renamed "Organization" to "Space" across app, stores, and Rust commands
- Standardized sidebar layout: Space switcher + Dashboard + Connections + AI Workspaces
- Extended `AppSidebar` to support workspace management (rename, delete, create)
- Sidebar width now persists via preferences
- All Tauri invoke parameter names use `snake_case` to match Rust
- All Tauri command errors surface as toasts (no silent failures)

### Fixed
- Chat history persistence — conversations survive app restarts
- Tab persistence across workspace switches
- Delete/rename parameter passing to Tauri commands
- Empty states for all tabs
- Preference commands (serde camelCase alignment)
- ContentArea wrapper removed — tab layouts and centering fixed
- Compiler warnings cleaned up
- First launch with existing space directory handled gracefully

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- Houston unified app with experience system
- Experience manifests (JSON-only and custom React tiers)
- Workspace management (create, rename, delete)
- 10 built-in tab components (chat, board, skills, files, connections, context, routines, channels, events, learnings)
- 11 React packages (@houston-ai/core, chat, board, layout, workspace, skills, connections, events, routines, review, memory)
- 8 Rust crates (houston-sessions, houston-db, houston-tauri, houston-channels, houston-events, houston-scheduler, houston-memory, houston-skills)
- create-houston-experience CLI
- Component showcase app

### Changed
- Rebranded from Keel & Deck to Houston
- Workspace convention: .keel/ → .houston/
- Events: KeelEvent → HoustonEvent
