// NOTHING — the red "Houston, we have a problem!" box and the green "report
// sent / Copy code" follow-up are both gone. Every reporting path stays.
//
// Asserted against the source rather than by calling the function: `error-toast`
// pulls the `@houston/engine-adapter` barrel and the Zustand store, neither of
// which loads under this suite's `--experimental-strip-types` runner. The
// invariant is worth a structural guard anyway — re-adding an `addToast` here is
// a one-line change that no other test in the repo would catch.
