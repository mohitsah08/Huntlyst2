/**
 * Drift guard: every model id a `PROVIDER_OVERRIDES` entry curates must actually
 * exist in the pi-ai catalog Houston ships. Overrides only add presentation
 * metadata (labels, descriptions, and — for a genuine cap — effort) layered onto
 * pi's runnable model set; an id pi doesn't ship is an ORPHAN that never renders
 * (the `claude-sonnet-5` override was exactly this bug, hidden because the unit
 * tests fed a synthetic catalog). This test reads the REAL pi-ai registry so a
 * new orphan can't slip in.
 *
 * pi-ai isn't an app dependency, so we resolve it through the host package (which
 * depends on it) via its stable node_modules symlink — no lockfile change, and
 * the app's `node --experimental-strip-types --test` runner imports it directly.
 * `dist/compat.js` (not `dist/index.js`) because pi-ai 0.80 moved the static
 * `getModel`/`getProviders` catalog reads used here onto its legacy `/compat`
 * entrypoint (the new default API is an instantiated `Models`/`Provider`
 * collection this drift check has no need to build).
