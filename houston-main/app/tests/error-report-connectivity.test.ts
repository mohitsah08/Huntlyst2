// PRODUCT-1383 (HOUSTON-APP-4PQ): a device-offline drop during a provider
// sign-out was re-captured to Sentry by the caller-authored-toast layer
// (`reportError`) after the engine-call layer had already classified the same
// failure as connectivity (HOU-1085) and deliberately declined the capture —
// 859 events / 171 users of pure "user was offline" noise, plus a red
// "sign out failed" toast stacked on the connectivity toast.
//
// PRODUCT-1640 flipped the Sentry half: the gate no longer DECLINES capture,
// it routes the class to the low-noise fingerprinted capture
// (`reportQuietError`), so an offline drop's raw diagnostic is findable in ONE
// `offline` issue while the red toast and per-event issues stay gone.
//
// Asserted against the source rather than by calling the functions: both
// modules pull i18n / analytics / the tauri barrel, none of which load under
// this suite's `--experimental-strip-types` runner (same constraint and same
// pattern as error-toast-not-shown.test.ts).
