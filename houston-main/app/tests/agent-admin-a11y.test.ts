/**
 * Agent Settings a11y guards. The node test runner has no DOM, so (per the
 * repo's React-test idiom) these assert on component source:
 *
 *  1. AccessChoice moves DOM focus to the newly-selected radio on arrow keys
 *     (WAI-ARIA roving-tabindex contract: focus follows selection).
 *  2. The master-detail Agent Settings page renders no <h1> (the minimal
 *     sidebar rail dropped its page title); the right-pane section titles are
 *     <h2>, not <h1>s.
