/**
 * `system` follows the OS only while the NATIVE WINDOW does.
 *
 * WKWebView derives `prefers-color-scheme` from the Tauri window's appearance,
 * so a window pinned to light or dark makes `matchMedia` answer that pinned mode
 * and stops the OS change event arriving: `system` then wears whichever mode was
 * picked last instead of following macOS. Two halves prevent it, one test group
 * each:
 *
 *  - the OS appearance is read only AFTER the window has been handed back
 *    (`systemPrefersDarkAfterRelease`, exercised against a fake webview);
 *  - the apply path passes `null` to release it, reaches the window through the
 *    serialized slot alone (`theme-native.test.ts` drives that slot's ordering),
 *    and reports either native call failing. That module reaches
 *    `@tauri-apps/api/window` and the Sentry / PostHog reporters, which only the
 *    bundler resolves, so it is asserted on source text, the same reason
 *    `os-bridge-barrel.test.ts` reads source.
