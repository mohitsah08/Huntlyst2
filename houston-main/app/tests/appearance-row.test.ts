/**
 * The Appearance row READS the preference in force; it never re-reads it.
 *
 * `loadThemePreference()` is the boot path, and it is a side-effecting getter:
 * it applies what it read, rewrites the device mirror, re-releases the native
 * window under `system`, and answers null when the READ itself failed. Calling
 * it again as the row mounts repeats all three, and on a failed read leaves the
 * row on the documented defaults while the app stays painted with the real
 * picks, so the next pick would persist a combination nobody chose. The row
 * shows `currentThemePreference()` instead, which is synchronous and is exactly
 * what the boot read put in force, and it WAITS on `themeReady()` before it can
 * write anything: the boot read is a round trip, and a row that mounted while it
 * was still in flight must not diff a pick against the defaults.
 *
 * The row imports `@houston-ai/core` and `react-i18next`, which only the bundler
 * resolves, so this asserts on source text (the same reason
 * `os-bridge-barrel.test.ts` reads source) with comments stripped, so a comment
 * can never satisfy it.
