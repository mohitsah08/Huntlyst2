/**
 * A failed read of the Academy record is NOT an empty one.
 *
 * The record answers "what has this user finished". A read that reached no
 * engine and found nothing on the device looks exactly like a fresh account, so
 * the page would hand a Mission Director the rank of a cadet and offer "Start"
 * on a chapter they finished months ago. This is the scenario the Academy's
 * failure screen exists for: a hosted user whose pod is cold, on a device whose
 * mirror is empty.
 *
 * Driven through the store's ports, so it is the real load path that answers.
