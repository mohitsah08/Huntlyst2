 * HOU-1043, restated for the shape that replaced it.
 *
 * The RULE has never changed: the way into the archive and the way back out
 * must both be readable at a glance, never an icon-only mystery whose meaning
 * hides in a tooltip. What changed is that the archive is a SECTION, so a
 * LABELLED TAB is both doors at once — it is always on screen, always says
 * "Archived" in words, and it wears `aria-current` while you are there. That
 * satisfies the rule better than the pill-in / back-button-out pair did: the
 * old pair was two controls for one place, and only one of them was visible at
 * a time.
 *
 * So the assertions below pin the tab's EXISTENCE for every caller, and the
 * absence of every piece of the old chrome — because each of those pieces
 * would now be a second, quieter way to say what the tab already says.
