/**
 * The create-agent flow's non-pure seams: the wiring that no render test and
 * no Playwright spec can observe.
 *
 * What the user can see is guarded where it is visible: the shared choice row
 * in `ui/core/tests/flow-choice-row.test.ts`, the typed answer on both
 * breakpoints in `packages/web/e2e/agent-onboarding.spec.ts` and
 * `packages/web/e2e/mobile/create-agent-brief.spec.ts`, the frame's recipe in
 * `dialog-recipes-flow.test.ts`, each question's model in
 * `choice-step-model.test.ts` / `role-step-model.test.ts`. What is left here is
 * the wiring between them — which component a screen composes, which reach its
 * filter is judged by, the field caps, the failure path's reporting, the one
 * way back, and the copy shipped in all three locales. None of those modules
 * loads under this suite's `--experimental-strip-types` runner (React, the
 * Zustand stores and the i18n barrel all come with them).
