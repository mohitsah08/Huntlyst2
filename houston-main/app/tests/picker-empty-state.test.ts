/**
 * HOU-979 / HOU-976 — the chat picker's empty state, and who may act on it.
 *
 * HOU-976 removed the ask-your-admin ending entirely. A team space has no shared
 * AI account for an admin to connect on anyone's behalf: every agent runs on the
 * AI account of whoever messages it, so the member staring at an empty picker is
 * always the person who can fix it. There is no role that changes the story.
 *
 * The bug these still pin (HOU-979): the decision read capabilities that had not
 * arrived yet, and the underlying role check answers TRUE for absent capabilities
 * (the single-player default) — so the surface promised a Connect action before
 * it knew a hub existed at all. A promise made and withdrawn is worse than no
 * promise, which is why `capabilitiesLoaded` remains the gate on the ACTION.
