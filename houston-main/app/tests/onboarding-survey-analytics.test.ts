// with it), so the survey's contract with PostHog is asserted against the
// source. Two things must hold or the dashboards go quiet: every survey event
// is in the AnalyticsEventName union (typos fail the build, absences don't),
// and every survey prop is in BOTH the property union and ALLOWED_PROPS —
// `cleanProps` drops anything missing from the Set, silently.
