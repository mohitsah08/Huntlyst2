//! One-shot localhost loopback listener for the OAuth sign-in redirect.
//!
//! Replaces the gethouston.ai relay page for the **desktop** app. After
//! provider consent, the browser is 302-redirected straight to the loopback:
//! `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/callback?code=...&state=...` for Google's
//! loopback+PKCE flow, or `http://localhost:<port>/auth/callback?...` for the
//! GCIP-BROKERED Microsoft flow (whose authorize URL is minted by GCIP
//! `createAuthUri` for ONE exact port — hence `exact_port` + `PortBusy` below —
//! and whose code is redeemed by GCIP server-side, never by this client). Both
//! loopback stacks (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`) are bound, because a browser
//! resolving `localhost` may connect over IPv6. Because the redirect is a
//! plain HTTP navigation (not a custom `houston://` scheme), the browser shows
//! NO "open this app?" dialog — it just loads the page. We then:
//!   1. check the `state` is OURS (a foreign one gets the stale page and we
//!      keep listening — see `callback.rs`),
//!   2. hand the query to the webview via the `auth://deep-link` event so the
//!      code redemption + GCIP (Firebase) sign-in run in JS (PKCE verifier for
//!      Google, `signInWithIdp` session for Microsoft — see
//!      `app/src/lib/identity/*`),
//!   3. serve a "you're signed in, return to Houston" page,
//!   4. pull the app window to the front — the old macOS deep-link path never
//!      did this, which is a big part of why users thought sign-in "hung",
//!   5. shut the listener down.
//!
//! PKCE puts the authorization code in the query string, which reaches the
//! server. (The implicit-flow `#access_token` fragment never leaves the
//! browser — but our clients use the authorization-code + PKCE flow, so the
//! code always arrives as `?code=`.)
//!
//! **Generation-scoped lifecycle.** `start_oauth_loopback` mints a monotonic
//! generation at command entry (so concurrent clicks are ordered by when the
//! USER made them, not by which coroutine finishes binding first), supersedes
//! the previous listener BEFORE binding and waits for its port to be released
//! (so a re-click reuses the same port instead of burning the next candidate —
//! four re-clicks used to exhaust the list for the rest of the run), and bails
//! out with `Superseded` if a newer generation overtakes it. It returns an
//! `attemptId`, and `cancel_oauth_loopback` acts only on a matching one, so an
//! abandoned attempt's fire-and-forget cancel can never kill the NEXT attempt's
//! port. Rust holds NO client secret and performs NO token exchange: that all
//! lives in TS.
//!
//! Web / mobile clients are NOT co-located with a local listener, so they use
//! the firebase-js-sdk popup instead (see `packages/web/src/identity/`).
