//! Refuse to reach tao's start-up assert when Windows cannot create a
//! window (PRODUCT-1726).
//!
//! tao's `EventLoop::new` registers a window class, creates a hidden
//! message-target window and attaches a comctl32 subclass to it, then
//! `assert!`s on the subclass result. On a machine where any of those calls
//! fails, the process dies with `assertion failed: subclass_result.as_bool()`
//! before a single window exists: the user clicks the icon, nothing appears,
//! and the only trace is a panic that carries no Win32 error code (Sentry
//! HOUSTON-APP-4RG: two machines, every event a retry of the one before).
//! Nothing Houston does precedes that call, so the shell cannot repair the
//! session; it can stop short of the assert. This module runs the same three
//! calls on a throwaway window first. A failure is retried briefly (a session
//! still settling after logon or an update-launched relaunch recovers), then
//! reported with the failing call and `GetLastError` so the next event names
//! the cause, shown to the user as a plain-language dialog with the remedy
//! that covers every known cause (close apps or restart), and the process
//! exits cleanly.
//!
//! Decision logic is pure and unit-tested on every host; only the Win32
//! calls are `cfg(windows)`.
