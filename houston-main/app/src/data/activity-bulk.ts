/**
 * Merge one patch into one mission — the single write rule both `update()` and
 * `applyBulkPatch` compose, and the local-write twin of the host's
 * `applyActivityUpdate` (`packages/domain/src/activities.ts`). It mirrors that
 * twin field for field:
 *
 *  - an `undefined` VALUE is not a value: it leaves the stored field alone,
 *    rather than writing `undefined` over a schema-required one (a caller that
 *    spreads an optional into a patch must not blank `status` or `title`).
 *  - `provider` is canonicalized on the way in, exactly as the CREATE path
 *    does (`data/activity.ts`): the app speaks display ids ("openai") and pi
 *    reads canonical ones off the row ("openai-codex"), so a display alias
 *    merged verbatim by an update leaves a row the engine cannot resolve a pin
 *    from.
 *  - `pending_interaction` follows the shared rule in @houston/protocol
 *    ({@link resolveInteractionPatch}): `null` deletes the key, a structurally
 *    valid object replaces it, and an absent (or malformed) one leaves it alone
 *    EXCEPT on a `status: "done"` patch, which strips the blocking steps and
 *    keeps the optional clean-finish offers — closing a mission is the user's
 *    own move and answers whatever it was waiting on, but "what to do next" and
 *    "save this as a Skill" keep rendering on the Done card.
