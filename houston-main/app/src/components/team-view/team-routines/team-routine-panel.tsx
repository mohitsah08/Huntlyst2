 * the setup interview, the draft→routine handoff and the panel chrome exist
 * exactly once. That machinery is per-agent by nature (its

 * owner instead of hoisting a controlled hook: hooks may not be called per row.
 *
 * The parent therefore drives it with a REQUEST and reads a REPORT rather than
 * owning the selection. The request is one-way and idempotent (applied once per
 * object identity), so the chat's own transitions — intake completing into a
 * draft, a draft being claimed by the created routine, Escape closing it — stay
 * inside the state machine that already handles them; the report is how the
 * section learns about them.
