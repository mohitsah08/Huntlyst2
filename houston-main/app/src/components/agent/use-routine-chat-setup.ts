/**

 * so it never shows as a board card — its only home is the Routines section's
 * setup-chat panel. A chat starts as a "draft" (no routine yet); once a routine
 * claims one (link resolution in `lib/routine-chat-setup.ts`, stored both
 * directions) the chat is the routine's for good, and reopening resumes it.
 * Routines without a chat get one on first open via `startForRoutine`. The
 * create kickoff offers the event wake only where the deployment supports
 * event triggers (`capabilities.triggers`).
