/**
 * Did an assignment write actually WIDEN who can reach the agent? Pure and
 * DOM-free so the rule is unit-tested away from the mutation.
 *
 * Comparing raw `assignments` lengths is not the same question. The everyone
 * sentinel is the EMPTY array, so the broadest share in the product looks like
 * a shrink, and materializing that sentinel into today's roster (which grants
 * nobody anything new) looks like a share. Both are answered correctly by
 * comparing the RESOLVED rosters {@link buildSharePeople} produces — sentinel
 * expanded to the whole team, org owner always present — and asking whether
 * anyone appears in the new one who was not in the old.
 *
 * Access LEVEL changes (Can use ↔ Manager) are deliberately not widening: the
 * `agent_shared` event answers "did more people get this agent", and a
 * promotion within the existing roster is a different act.
