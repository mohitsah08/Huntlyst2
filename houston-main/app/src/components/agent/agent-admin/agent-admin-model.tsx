/**
 * "Allowed models" section (Access group, multiplayer only): the manager's
 * allowed-models ceiling, i.e. which models members may run this agent on
 * ({@link AgentModelsSection}, written via `setAgentSettings.allowedModels`).
 * Each member then picks their own model from the allowed set in the composer.
 * Rendered flush in the right pane (no card wrapper).
 *
 * The model directory is the shared AI-hub catalog ({@link useHubCatalog}) so
 * this editor and the AI Models hub never drift. The catalog is local (built
 * from the host's `/v1/catalog`), so it only ever loads, never errors here; the
 * catalog query's sole owner surfaces any load failure as a toast (we never
 * re-observe it, to avoid a double toast). The editor renders only once BOTH
 * the settings (Teams-gated) and the catalog are present; while either loads a
 * quiet spinner shows.
 *
 * The Access group is multiplayer-only, so single-player never reaches here:
 * single-player has no ceiling and its sole user sets the model in the composer.
 *
 * The gateway is the real enforcer of the ceiling this editor writes.
