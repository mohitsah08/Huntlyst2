/**
 * The compact "this one will fail" chip a routine row carries (PRODUCT-1475).
 *
 * A routine list is where a person notices a broken automation, so the warning
 * has to live on the ROW, not only inside the routine's screen. It renders only
 * for a routine whose resolved provider is confirmed unusable AND whose creator
 * is the viewer — the viewer's `/providers` answer says nothing about anyone
 * else's account (see `useRoutineProviderHealth`). Healthy and still-checking
 * rows render nothing: a list of chips saying "fine" is noise.
 *
 * A component rather than a plain function because it resolves the pair and
 * probes the provider through hooks; the grid's slot takes the rendered node.
