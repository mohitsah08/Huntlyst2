/**
 * ONE agent's entire Files wiring: the read, every mutation, the capability
 * gates, the translated labels and the four overlays a Files surface needs.
 *
 * **Why it is a module and not a component.** There can only ever be one answer
 * to "what happens when I rename this file". Copying the wiring into a surface
 * would mean a second capability gate that can drift, a second upload intake, a
 * second delete confirm, a second move-conflict flow, and a bug fixed in one
 * place but not the other. So it lives here once; `agent-files-surface.tsx`
 * renders it, and the employee screen's Files section (`team-view/team-files/`) is
 * nothing but a frame around that.
 *
 * **It is also what keeps the read cache-shared.** The tree comes from
 * `useFiles(agent.folderPath)` — query key `queryKeys.files(agentPath)` — the
 * SAME cache entry every other files read uses, so every mutation's
 * invalidation lands in one place and `use-agent-invalidation.ts`'s
 * `FilesChanged` → `queryKeys.files(path)` refreshes whatever is on screen.
 * There is no second key and no cross-agent fan-out anywhere in the Files story.
 *
 * The hook returns props rather than rendering: `agent-files-surface.tsx` is
 * the one component that assembles them.
