 * both the prominent header Share button and the buried Agent-settings block, so
 * the two entry points never drift on which surface a context opens:
 *
 * - `"manage"` — the Drive-style {@link canShowAgentShareBlock} block + share
 *   dialog: a multiplayer TEAM space where the caller manages this agent.
 * - `"inviteTeam"` — a PERSONAL space on a spaces-capable host: personal spaces
 *   are non-invitable (sharing always goes through a team), so instead of
 *   hiding, the Share affordance offers to move the agent into a team. Opens
 *   the ShareViaTeamFlow.
 * - `"view"` — a multiplayer caller who can SEE the agent but can't manage it (a
 *   plain member / an admin who only uses it). Google-Docs parity: they still
 *   open a read-only people list rather than a dead button. The gateway withholds
 *   the full assignee roster from non-managers, so the list shows the truthful
 *   subset it can resolve (always at least the viewer) — never a management UI.
 * - `"none"` — desktop / self-host (no multiplayer): render nothing.
 *
 * Personal-space precedence is deliberate: a personal space must NEVER show the
 * team share dialog (its `addOrgMember` 403s `personal_space`), so `inviteTeam`
 * wins over `manage` whenever the caller is in a personal space on a spaces host.
