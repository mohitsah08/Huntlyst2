 * a chat: this is the one surface for setting up a routine, changing it, and
 * finding out what it did. No side-by-side editor, no run-history list.
 *
 * There is exactly ONE header, owned by the inner AIBoard detail panel (never a
 * second one stacked on top of it): its close X deselects (closes the panel, the
 * list never disappears), and the auto "Mission: {title}" line is overridden to
 * read "Routine: {name}". Pre-activity states (intake, a creating draft, a
 * loading routine) render a matching slim header with the same close X, portaled
 * into that same panel.
 *
 * The chat is a real mission under the hood (every board filters it out via the
 * routine-setup sentinel); it joins the app's shared shell panel just like the
 * mission board, so both surfaces are one UI path.
 *
 * The chat is permanent (HOU-725): once a routine claims it via
 * `setup_activity_id`, reopening that routine resumes this same conversation, so
 * a finished chat is never auto-archived.
