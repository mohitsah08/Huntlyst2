/**
 * The ONE machinery that stops a trigger routine saying "verifying" forever:
 * the per-row status map with a concrete error overlaid on every routine whose
 * status has been absent past the verification timeout.
 *
 * A trigger routine that never gets a status item would otherwise spin without
 * end — an older host, a create that silently failed, or an agent whose trigger
 * rows the backend cannot see (PRODUCT-1772: the routine screen's activation
 * chip read the raw status and had no timeout at all, so a moved agent's
 * webhook routine showed "Checking your trigger…" across restarts). Every
 * surface that renders a trigger status resolves it through here — the grid's
 * row badges via the view model, the routine screen's chip directly — so no
 * second copy of the timeout rule can drift.
 *
 * `triggerRowIds` are the rows that can sit in a "verifying" state at all;
 * `statusItems` is the fetched list (`null` when the host serves no triggers).
 * Tracks when each row first appears WITHOUT a status, and once that has lasted
 * past the timeout, synthesizes the error so the row/chip stop spinning. A real
 * status item, when it finally lands, always wins.
