 * zero model calls). The intake collects — at most — WHAT the user wants (an
 * intent) and WHEN it runs (a {@link WakePick}), then completes with an
 * {@link IntakeResult}. Only then is the model called: the draft chat opens with
 * a handoff carrying everything collected (see `lib/routine-chat-handoff.ts`).
 *
 * These types are the single source of truth: the surface that mounts the
 * intake is built against this file alone, so keep it authoritative.
