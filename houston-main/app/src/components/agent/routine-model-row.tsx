/**
 * The routine screen's Model section body (PRODUCT-1475): the resolved
 * provider + model as a picker, whether that account actually works, and — when
 * the routine carries no pin — the quiet line saying it follows the agent.
 *
 * The health claim is scoped: `/providers` answers for the VIEWER's credential
 * scope while a fired routine runs on its CREATOR's, so a teammate's routine
 * gets a plain sentence about whose account runs it instead of a badge derived
 * from the wrong one. Saving and enabling stay allowed either way — this row
 * informs, it never blocks.
