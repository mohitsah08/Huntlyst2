 * reconnect hand-off, and the machinery that stops a row saying "verifying"
 * forever.
 *
 * The FETCH stays with the caller and everything downstream of it lives here:
 * the employee's Routines list (`team-routines/use-team-trigger-statuses.ts`)
 * reads the status and hands it over. The timeout rule itself lives in
 * `useTriggerStatusTimeouts`, shared with the routine screen's activation chip:
 * it is the only reason a trigger row cannot lie, so there is exactly one copy.
 *
 * The contract: `routines[i].id` and `statusItems[j].routine_id` are both the
 * GRID's row id.
 *
 * `triggersEnabled` gates ONLY offering NEW event triggers (the wizard's event
 * option and the app catalog). Status runs off the routines themselves: a
 * routine that can never fire here must still show its health (an older host
 * 404s -> the rows fall back to the unknown state, then time out).
