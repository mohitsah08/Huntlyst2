/**
 * The Routines grid's per-row leading glyph, decided purely from the
 * routine's wake binding (kept DOM/React-free so it unit-tests under bare
 * node; the `.tsx` hook turns each descriptor into the actual element):
 *
 *  - `schedule` — a cron routine; the grid keeps its default clock glyph.
 *  - `webhook`  — an incoming-webhook trigger; a webhook mark.
 *  - `composio` — an app-event trigger; the triggering app's logo, resolved
 *                 from its `toolkit` slug against the integrations catalog.
 *
 * A trigger with no `kind` is a Composio binding (the original, pre-webhook
 * shape), so it falls through to `composio` with its toolkit slug.
