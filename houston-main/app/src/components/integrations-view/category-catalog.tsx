/**
 * The browse plane: the full connectable catalog grouped into flat category
 * sections (the reference's "Featured / Productivity / Creativity" stacks),
 * replacing the old dropdown-filtered load-more grid. Grouping IS the
 * navigation, so there is no pagination and no category picker — every
 * connectable app is present, sorted into its section. Each section shows a
 * capped preview until the user expands it, so the first paint stays bounded
 * even over the ~1000-app catalog; every section expands independently. A row
 * BODY click opens the app's "more info" modal ({@link AppInfoDialog}); only
 * the row's `+` (or the modal's CTA) connects.
 *
 * An app whose connection is pending or errored is NOT pulled out of here:
 * only a WORKING connection leaves the catalog (for the Installed strip), so a
 * failed connect leaves the app exactly where the user pressed it, wearing its
 * status and retrying from its own `+`. Its modal is the one place the
 * connection can be removed.
 *
 * An in-flight OAuth belongs to its OWN row (the row expands with the live
 * phase): there is no page-level waiting panel, so feedback never appears 90px
 * above whatever the user is reading, and no row is ever disabled because a
 * different app is connecting. Flows are per toolkit and concurrent; the shared
 * flow state (`connectFlow`) outlives this surface, so switching tabs or leaving
 * the page never kills a poll. The spotlight REPEATS rows that also sit in a
 * category section, so each row carries an origin key and `useCatalogSections`
 * hands the expansion to the single copy the user pressed — the duplicate keeps
 * only its `+` spinner.
