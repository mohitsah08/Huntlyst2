 * sections at once (the curated "Most used" spotlight repeats category rows), so
 * `owns` decides which single copy shows the inline connect state and `onOpen`
 * carries the pressed row's origin into the info modal — connecting from there
 * lands the state on the row the user actually opened.
 *
 * `statusOf` answers with a pending / errored connection's status for the apps
 * that hold one: those rows wear it instead of their blurb and stay right here,
 * duplicates included, like any other app in the section.
