/**
 * The catalog app's modal — a row-body click opens it: brand art, name, the
 * app's category chips, its FULL description (the row truncates to one line),
 * and the connect CTA. `toolkit === null` keeps it closed. Connecting from here
 * closes the modal and hands off to the surface's one connect flow (the row's
 * inline card takes over, same as its `+`).
 *
 * `broken` = this app holds a connection that never went active, so the same
 * modal is where that connection is dealt with: it wears the status chip beside
 * the categories, says what happened, and its footer offers the two ways out —
 * Finish connecting / Reconnect (the same hand-off, from the row the user
 * opened) and Remove, which disconnects the half-made connection. There is no
 * second dialog for a broken app: a catalog row opens the catalog's modal,
 * whatever state its app is in.
