/**
 * The Integrations tab of a catalog surface: any surface-specific `children`
 * over the grouped category catalog. It is
 * CONTROLLED: the surface owns the ONE search + category (its `controls` row
 * above BOTH sections) and threads them in as `query` + `category`, so the same
 * filter narrows this discovery area and every row in the Installed strip.
 * The connect flow is app-wide shared state, so leaving the surface never
 * kills an in-flight OAuth poll.
 *
 * There is NO recovery section at the top of the pane: an app whose connection
 * is pending or errored stays in its own category rows, wearing its status, and
 * is finished or removed from there. While the data settles it shows the
 * {@link CatalogSkeleton}, which mirrors the grouped catalog it replaces so
 * resolving costs no layout shift.
