/**
 * A read-only resolver from an `integration_execute` ACTION to the process
 * block header's branded row — the app-side counterpart to `ui/chat`'s
 * `resolveActionBrand` port (ui/chat stays provider-unaware).
 *
 * Two action grammars, one row:
 *
 * - A CUSTOM executor address (`tools.<slug>....<tool>`, HOU-1049) brands as
 *   the integration's own name — from the custom definitions list, else the
 *   prettified slug (a gateway-fronted web surface may null the list) — with
 *   the service favicon when the view carries one (PRODUCT-1172), else the
 *   wrench glyph (`icon: "tool"`), and the humanized tool name
 *   ("Listing jobs").
 * - A Composio action slug (e.g. `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`) resolves its toolkit as
 *   the longest catalog slug prefixing it (`toolkitOfActionSlug`), that
 *   toolkit resolves to a name + logo through the shared brand resolver, and
 *   the action humanizes to a present-tense label ("Sending email"). A
 *   catalog MISS still yields a branded row — the prettified toolkit name
 *   with NO logo — so the row degrades gracefully and never shows a raw slug
 *   or a broken image.
 *
 * Stable across renders unless the catalog or the custom list moves.
