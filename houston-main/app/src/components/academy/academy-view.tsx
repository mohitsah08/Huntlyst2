/**
 * Houston Academy: learning the product as a climb rather than a manual.
 *
 * A TOP-LEVEL view for everyone, under About me. It is ungated on purpose:
 * learning the product is not a preference and belongs to nobody's admin
 * territory, so it is a row of its own and owns the whole window, with no back
 * bar because there is no level above it.
 *
 * It wears the app's page strip, the same fixed 48px band Skills, Integrations
 * and Admin wear, so the screen's name sits where a user has
 * already learned to read it. The strip owns the h1, which is why nothing below
 * it is a second page title.
 *
 * Two halves under the strip. The status header says where the user stands, with
 * their own face inside the rank ring. The path below says what to do next:
 * each chapter's lessons, then the stops that are still to come. Both read the
 * ONE stored record (`useAcademyProgress()`), so the rank and the path can
 * never tell the user two different stories about the same lesson.
 *
 * A record that failed to LOAD takes the whole page instead of either half. An
 * unread record is indistinguishable from an empty one, so drawing the halves
 * would hand a Mission Director the rank of a fresh cadet and offer "Start" on
 * a lesson they finished months ago. Saying so, with a retry, is the only
 * honest screen.
