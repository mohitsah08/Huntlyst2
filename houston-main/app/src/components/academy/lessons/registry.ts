/**
 * Every lesson the app ships, by id. Data only — the runner plays whatever is
 * here and the Academy path lists it under its `chapterId`
 * (`lib/academy/academy-chapters.ts`), so adding a lesson is adding an entry
 * plus its copy in every `locales/<lang>/academy.json`. Entry order IS the
 * order a chapter lists its lessons in.
 *
 * A beat's `advanceOn` is one of `LessonSignalSpec`
 * (`lib/academy/lesson-signals.ts`); a lesson that needs a new kind of signal
 * adds a member there, its reading in `./use-lesson-signals.ts` and its arming
 * rule in `./lesson-arming.ts`. A beat no single real control can teach is a
 * `panel` (`./lesson-panel.tsx` maps each id to its component).
 *
 * A LESSON ID IS ALSO A COPY KEY. Every beat resolves its words under
 * `lessons.<lessonId>.…` in the `academy` namespace, the same node the shared
 * lesson chrome lives in, so the chrome's own keys (`exit`, `progress`,
 * `stepCount`, `video`) are reserved: an id equal to one of them would file a
 * lesson's copy on top of the words every lesson reads. Ids stay lowercase
 * slugs and stay clear of that list, and `academy-lesson-registry.test.ts`
 * holds both halves of the rule against the English locale.
