/**
 * Whether a beat may hand the user the real control it points at.
 *
 * The companion rule to `lessonAdvance`: that one says when a beat is OVER,
 * this one says when it is allowed to BEGIN. A beat that decides by comparing
 * the world against a snapshot of it is blind until the snapshot exists, and a
 * click that lands in that blind window is the one act the lesson can never
 * see: the conversation the user just made becomes part of the baseline, the
 * count and the baseline agree forever, and the run is stranded on a beat the
 * user has already done.
 *
 * So the whisper keeps the veil whole until its reading is ready — the target
 * is not merely unlit, it is not reachable — and the beat opens the moment the
 * snapshot lands. Pure, so it is decided once and tested without React
 * (`app/tests/academy-lesson-arming.test.ts`).
