/**
 * Pure, DOM-free logic behind the top-level access choice above the People
 * roster: "Everyone on your team" vs "Only specific people".
 *
 * It writes the SAME wire shape the Share dialog and the People roster write
 * (`PUT /v1/agents/:slug/assignments`, set-replace), against the existing
 * everyone-agent sentinel: an EMPTY assignee set means org-wide access
 * ({@link isSharedWithEveryone}, `tauriAgents.setAssignments` "Empty =
 * everyone"), and any explicit set means exactly those people. There is no
 * third state on the wire, so the choice is a faithful two-way mapping:
 *
 * - "Everyone on your team" writes `[]`.
 * - "Only specific people" MATERIALIZES the roster the everyone sentinel
 *   currently expands to ({@link buildSharePeople} — every member, owner as
 *   manager), which is exactly what the first per-person edit does today. The
 *   write therefore changes nobody's effective access; it only makes the
 *   implicit roster explicit so people can then be removed one by one.
 *
 * The one thing the sentinel CANNOT carry is a per-person level: `[]` has no
 * room for a Manager grant, so switching to "Everyone" drops any manager other
 * than the org owner (whom {@link buildSharePeople} always re-adds). That is a
 * real change to materialized assignments, which is why
 * {@link everyoneChangesAssignments} exists: the UI confirm-gates the switch
 * whenever it would alter anyone's resolved access.
 *
 * The GATEWAY is the sole enforcer; these helpers only shape the affordance.
