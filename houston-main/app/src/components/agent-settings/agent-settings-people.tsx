/**
 * The People section of the agent settings page: the team-wide access question
 * on top, the per-person roster below.
 *
 * The choice is the same always-visible {@link AccessChoice} segmented control
 * the app + model ceilings use, wired to the real everyone-agent semantics via
 * `agent-people-choice` (empty assignee set = everyone; an explicit set = only
 * those people). BOTH directions are confirm-gated, because both replace the
 * whole roster in one write: switching to Everyone says what it discards
 * (and warns destructively when the viewer is discarding their OWN Manager
 * grant), switching to specific people says how many it is freezing and that
 * future teammates are no longer included. Writes go through ONE shared
 * optimistic {@link useShareAgent} — the same instance the roster rows use, so
 * one in-flight write disables every control here and two set-replaces can
 * never race.
 *
 * In "Everyone" mode the roster renders STATIC: per-person levels are not the
 * agent's state while the sentinel is set, and a live control there would
 * silently materialize the roster (the mirror of the confirm-gated switch).
 * This follows the `AllowlistEditor` idiom, which likewise stops offering
 * per-item controls in its "any" mode.
 *
 * The section owns the org query, so the roster refetches on mount when stale
 * and the body waits behind a skeleton until it lands. The choice itself hides
 * until the roster is readable ({@link canChooseAgentAccess}): with no members
 * to expand, "Only specific people" would write the empty set and mean the
 * opposite of its label.
