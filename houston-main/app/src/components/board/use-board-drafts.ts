 * Composer draft persistence for the board, shared by both views. Exposes the
 * text-only draft map AIBoard expects and a setter that writes back to the
 * draft store, so what the user typed survives navigation between missions.
 *
 * AIBoard keys its new-mission composer with the plain "new-conversation"
 * literal, but the store scopes that draft per agent (HOU-730) — otherwise a
 * first message parked for a sleeping agent shows up in every other agent's
 * composer. This hook translates between the two on read and write, and a
 * seeded open (`seedDraft`) reads and writes the seed's slot instead.
