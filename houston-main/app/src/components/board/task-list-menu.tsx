/**
 * The phone task list's overflow control: the round "…" chip in the drilled
 * header and the menu it opens. The ITEMS are the caller's (Search, Archived,
 * the employee's other sections); the chip, its name and its geometry are
 * this control's.
 *
 * Search hides behind it because an always-on field would take the screen's
 * first line from the tasks, and most visits scroll rather than search. The
 * archive hides behind it because it is the one band that is not part of the
 * list's job — reaching it is a deliberate act, not a scroll away.
