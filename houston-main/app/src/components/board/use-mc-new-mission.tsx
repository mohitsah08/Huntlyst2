/**
 * A board's "New task" flow.
 *
 * The board is cross-agent, so the act needs an owner — but it only ASKS when
 * there is a real choice (`newMissionTarget`). A board pinned to one agent, or
 * a team holding one, opens that agent's composer straight away; anything else
 * opens a MENU hung off the button. The modal picker no longer serves this
 * path at all: it stopped the world for a three-item choice and covered the
 * rail the user was reading those names from.
 *
 * {@link AgentPickerDialog} survives for the other path — an EMPTY board
 * auto-opening its composer, where there is no button to hang a menu on.
 *
 * Picking scopes the right panel to that agent (`pendingAgent`) and opens the
 * empty composer; the pending agent clears when the panel closes unselected.
