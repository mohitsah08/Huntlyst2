 * the chat is covering. Both render only on desktop: below md the panel is
 * already the whole screen and its close affordances are the way out.
 *
 * They read the ONE persisted preference (`chatWide`, `stores/ui.ts`), so a
 * chat opened next on any opted-in surface comes up the way the user left
 * the last one. Whether the preference takes effect is the SURFACE's call
 * (`useShellDetailPanel({ wide })`): a host that renders the toggle is one
 * that has opted in, so the toggle never promises a layout it can't deliver.
