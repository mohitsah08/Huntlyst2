/**
 * Cross-agent Archived view for Mission Control: a column-less list of every
 * archived mission; clicking one opens its chat; sending re-activates it and
 * hands the user back to this screen's active board, with the mission's chat
 * open, to keep the conversation in view.
 *
 * `agents` is ALWAYS the full workspace roster, whoever is rendering: the sweep
 * behind it (`useMissionControlArchived`) keys the one shared
 * `all-conversations` query on it. An employee's archive narrows what it RENDERS
 * through `scope` instead (the one-sweep rule, `useAgentBoardScope`).
 *
 * It says nothing about WHERE it is: the archive is a MODE of Tasks, entered
 * from the active board's "Archived" button and left by the "Back to tasks"
 * button this screen's own toolbar carries, so a title, a qualifier or a trail
 * crumb here would be the third thing on one screen saying the same word.
