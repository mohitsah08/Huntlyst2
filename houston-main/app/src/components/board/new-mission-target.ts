/**
 * Who a new task belongs to, before the composer opens.
 *
 * A scoped board can span agents, so "New task" cannot just open a composer — it
 * has to know whose. But asking is only honest when there is genuinely a
 * choice, and there often is not:
 *
 * - the board is PINNED to one agent, so the user already answered the
 *   question by narrowing the board they are looking at. Asking again is the
 *   app forgetting what it is showing;
 * - the team holds exactly ONE agent, so there is nothing to pick.
 *
 * In both cases the composer opens straight onto that agent. Only a genuinely
 * ambiguous board asks, and it asks with a MENU hung off the button rather
 * than a modal — a modal for "which of these three" stops the world for a
 * choice the user can make in place, and it covered the rail they were reading
 * the agents' names from a second ago.
 *
 * Pure, and unit-tested in `app/tests/new-mission-target.test.ts`.
