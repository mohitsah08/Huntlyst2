/**
 * The cross-agent nav handoff, consumed by the surface that OWNS the mission.
 *
 * Every "open this mission" navigation — a session-finished notification, a
 * @mention row, the command palette's recent missions, the archived → active
 * handoff — publishes its target as `activityPanelId` and lets a board open it.
 * Two things decide who may:
 *
 * - **Only the screen on the glass.** Several kept-alive boards are mounted at
 *   once, and an unguarded consumer lets a hidden employee's board eat the target
 *   and clear it.
 * - **Only the surface the target belongs to.** A board is two surfaces that
 *   swap — the active one and the archive — and each holds half the workspace.
 *   `pendingSurface` names the target's own surface, decided once from the raw
 *   sweep rows (`pendingMissionSurface`); a target belonging to the OTHER
 *   surface is left completely alone, published and unconsumed, so the owner of
 *   the two can swap boards and the right one can claim it.
 *
 * That second guard has to live HERE rather than in the owner because of
 * ordering: React runs child effects before parent effects, so this hook fires
 * a full commit BEFORE the owner's surface router (`useBoardSurfaceOnNav`) gets
 * a chance to route anything. Consuming first and asking later is what made an
 * archived @mention open a blank dead chat — the active board swallowed the
 * target and cleared it before the archive was ever asked for.
