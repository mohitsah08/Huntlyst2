/**
 * Settings → Danger Zone: delete the ACTIVE team space for good (PRODUCT-1410).
 *
 * Shown on `showWorkspaceDanger`, which holds when all three do — the
 * deployment can delete a space at all (`capabilities.workspaceDelete`, the
 * gateway's feature-detect flag: absent on desktop/self-host, where the one
 * personal workspace is not deletable, and on gateways that predate the route),
 * the active space is a team (a personal space goes with the account, never on
 * its own), and the caller owns it
 * (PRODUCT-1247). Cosmetic gates all: the gateway is the sole enforcer, and
 * its two business rejections (`has_members`, `subscription_active`) come
 * back as plain informational toasts that say what to do first.
 *
 * Confirming pre-checks those two rejections against fresh active-org reads
 * (`GET /v1/org` roster + `GET /v1/org/billing`, PRODUCT-1426), and the
 * answer picks the UX shape, never the outcome:
 * a provably-deletable solo team switches the user to the default space with
 * the success toast immediately (the slow gateway delete finishes behind the
 * switch, with the store's rollback as the race net); anything the pre-check
 * can't prove waits for the gateway's verdict, so the user is never told
 * "deleted" about a space that still stands — rejections are fast, it's the
 * destruction that is slow.
