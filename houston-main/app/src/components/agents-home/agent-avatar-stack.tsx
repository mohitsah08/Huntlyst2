 * The phone Agents home's avatar: the agent's helmet, large, and — when the
 * agent holds several conversations — fanned out as a STACK of three cards,
 * the front one straight and two tilted behind it to its left. The fan is the
 * row's way of saying "there is more than one thing in here" before the user
 * taps; an agent with at most one task wears a single mark, because a stack
 * over one conversation would promise a list that is not there.
 *
 * The back cards are the same helmet in the same colour, each on its own
 * opaque disc so the three read as separate solid cards where they overlap. Decorative: the row's text names the agent and counts its
 * work, so the whole mark is hidden from assistive tech.
 *
 * The running ring rides the front card only, through `HoustonAvatar`'s own
 * `running` treatment, so the one "something is running here" ring the rail
 * draws is the one drawn here.
