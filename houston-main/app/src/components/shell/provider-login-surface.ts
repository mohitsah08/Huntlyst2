/**
 * Who acts on a `ProviderLoginUrl` event (HOU-676).
 *
 * On the v3 wire the runtime can't touch the user's browser: the adapter
 * surfaces the OAuth URL as a bus event and expects the ACTIVE view to act on
 * it. The AI hub, the provider picker, and the onboarding login step each
 * mount a handler — but a login can also be launched from surfaces that don't
 * (the in-chat reconnect card, the store-driven card), and an event nobody
 * consumes is a sign-in button that silently does nothing.
 *
 * So the shell mounts ONE global fallback (`ProviderLoginFallback`), and every
 * dedicated login surface CLAIMS the event while mounted. The fallback acts
 * only when no claim is held — never alongside a dedicated surface, which
 * would double-open the browser or stack two dialogs.
