/**
 * The glyph and the badge a team block's header carries.
 *
 * **Only while it is FOLDED.** Open, the block's agent rows carry their own
 * running ring and needs-you chip, and a header repeating them would
 * count the same waiting work twice inside one block. Folded, those rows are
 * not on screen at all, and "collapse this team" must never mean "stop telling
 * me my agents need something" — so the header says it on their behalf.
 *
 * It reuses the agent row's OWN components rather than dressing a team badge to
 * look like one: `RunningRing` is literally the ring an avatar wears, and
 * `NeedsYouChip` is literally the chip. A second treatment drawn a hair
 * differently would read as a second kind of urgency.
 *
 * A curried builder rather than a plain function: the labels come from `t()`
 * and the summaries from a hook, so binding them once per render keeps every
 * block asking the same question with the same words.
