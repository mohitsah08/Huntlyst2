 * will keep, so booting reads as the screen settling rather than a separate
 * splash handing over to the workspace.
 *
 * One component covers every boot blocker — the engine handshake (EngineGate,
 * desktop + web), the auth-session resolve, and the first workspace/agent load
 * (App.tsx) — so the whole startup reads as a single continuous loading state.
 *
 * Reads the i18n singleton directly (not useTranslation): the web EngineGate
 * renders this OUTSIDE <I18nextProvider>, and at gate time the saved language
 * isn't applied yet anyway (LanguageGate mounts after the engine is ready).
