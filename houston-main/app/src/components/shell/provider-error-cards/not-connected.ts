 * settles the turn as a typed `unauthenticated` card. Two things about that
 * card only the SURFACE can resolve:
 *
 *  - `provider` may be empty — the runtime can't name one (nothing is
 *    connected) and the SDK only knows the composer's pick when the send
 *    carried an explicit switch. The chat itself always knows its provider.
 *  - `failed_prompt` marks a send that never reached the engine: retrying
 *    with the generic "try again" prompt would arrive with no context, so
 *    "Send again" must resend the original text.
