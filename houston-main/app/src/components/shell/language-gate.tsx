/**
 * First-run language flow, styled like the rest of setup. A single beat: a
 * clean centered white card on the calm grey {@link FirstRunScreen} background,
 * the languages offered as plain buttons (one per language, named in its own
 * language). No language is pre-selected — every button is the same neutral
 * grey, so no option is nudged over the others; each applies + persists its
 * language and advances immediately on click. The OS locale is still detected,
 * but only to choose the language the screen's own copy renders in. Language is
 * changeable later from Settings.
 *
 * This is the first screen of the app. Shown before sign-in so a
 * Spanish/Portuguese speaker sees the sign-in flow in their own language. Skipped
 * once the `locale` engine preference is set; Settings has the same picker for
 * later changes.
