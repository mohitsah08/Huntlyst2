/**
 * The closed vocabulary of `data-tour-target` anchors the guided surfaces use.
 *
 * A caller names one of these and builds its selector with `tourSelector`,
 * never a hand-written string, so a typo is a compile error instead of a
 * spotlight that silently finds nothing. Every name here is rendered by a real
 * element: `sidebar-nav-sections.tsx` and `sidebar-nav-rows.tsx` (the
 * workspace menu's destinations, the Academy included, which the
 * phone's More menu draws too), `sidebar-workspace-menu.tsx`
 * (`workspaceMenu`, the trigger at the rail's foot),
 * `sidebar-workspace-menu-items.tsx` and `mobile-more-menu.tsx`
 * (`nav-settings`), `sidebar-header-actions.tsx` (`newAgent`, the rail's "+"),
 * `@houston-ai/layout`'s sidebar (`agents`),
 * `workspace-shell.tsx` (`main`), `new-mission-button.tsx` (`newMission` on
 * desktop), `agents-home-list.tsx` (`newAgent` again, the phone's own create
 * control), and `mobile-nav-bar.tsx` (`newMission` again — the round compose
 * beside the pill is the phone's only one; `mobileMenu`, the More button the
 * phone's long tail of destinations is reached through; and
 * `mobileAgentsTab`, the item that opens the Agents home), and the task chat
 * on either screen: `shell-panel-card.tsx` (`taskChat`, the desktop detail
 * panel) and `mission-chat-screen.tsx` (`taskChat` again, the phone's pushed
 * chat).
 *
 * The vocabulary is shared: the Academy's lessons spotlight these anchors
 * (`components/academy/lessons/registry.ts`) and the e2e specs address the
 * shell by them.
