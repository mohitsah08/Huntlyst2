 * FOLDED team's header wears it around the team's glyph, on behalf of the agent
 * rows it is hiding. Same component, because a second ring drawn a hair
 * differently would read as a second kind of running.
 *
 * It is sized off what it circles (`diameter`, the rail's 20px glyph column
 * by default), not off its contents, so every team mark wears the same 24px
 * ring. It overhangs the column by 2px a side, which the 28px row absorbs
 * vertically.
