/**
 * The way back from a DRILLED page header — a level a section opened INSIDE a
 * top-level screen, wearing the screen's own lozenge grammar:
 *
 *     (‹ 🏢 Admin) (Analytics)(Activity)
 *
 * Three rules make an inner level legible, and every drilled header follows
 * them:
 *
 * - **The chip precedes the cluster and never collapses into a menu** — the
 *   way back must stay visible at every width.
 * - **The chip wears the DESTINATION's glyph** — the same mark the top-level
 *   identity lozenge wears, so "where this goes" is recognizable at a glance,
 *   not just readable.
 * - **The drilled cluster's identity is text-only.** Only a top-level
 *   identity lozenge carries a glyph, so the bare words plus this chip are
 *   how an inner page reads as inner.
 *
 * A quiet unpainted lozenge on its own track: a door, not a place, so it
 * never takes the active fill.
