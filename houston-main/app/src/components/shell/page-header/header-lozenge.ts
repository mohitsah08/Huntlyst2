/**
 * The Safari tab, as one class list — and the TRACK the cluster sits in.
 *
 * Safari's grammar, deliberately: the tabs sit ON a quietly darker contained
 * track (`tab-track`), and only the OPEN one is painted with the SCREEN's
 * own tone (`tab-active`: white in light, the frosted screen's composited
 * tone in dark), so the open tab reads as the screen showing through the
 * track, the same grammar as a board card in its column. The track is what
 * holds the cluster together as one control, so
 * the tabs themselves carry no borders and no container of their own, and
 * everything is fully rounded — the pill's radius is half its height, never
 * a squared corner.
 *
 * Geometry: 20px line + 4 + 4 = a 28px pill, inside the track's 2px padding
 * = the same 32px the cluster has always stood in the fixed strip.
