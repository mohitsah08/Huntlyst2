/**
 * One pending team invitation, offered at the top of the rail, directly under
 * its top line, ALWAYS visible (never behind a hover or a menu — the account
 * menu would hide the whole thing behind a click, and an invitation nobody
 * sees is an invitation nobody accepts).
 *
 * The inviter is named only when the gateway sends something human; today
 * `invitedBy` is the inviter's user id, which no invitee-side read can resolve
 * (they are not in that org yet), so the card names the TEAM instead of putting
 * a database id in front of the user — see `inviterDisplayName`.
 *
 * Both actions route through hooks that own the whole surfacing story (list
 * refresh, workspace reload, expected-state toasts), so the row here has no
 * `catch` of its own: the card disappears when the refreshed list drops the
 * invite.
 *
 * Accept and Decline EXCLUDE each other through the shared {@link
 * InviteActionLock}, claimed synchronously before either mutation starts.
 * `AsyncButton`'s own rage-click guard is per button and `busy` only lands on
 * the next commit, so without the lock an Accept immediately followed by a
 * Decline fired both calls and the loser toasted a confusing
 * `already_member` / `invite_not_found` at a user who did nothing wrong.
