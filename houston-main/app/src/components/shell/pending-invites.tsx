/**
 * The invite inbox on the expanded sidebar rail: every pending invitation
 * addressed to the caller, each with Accept / Decline. Renders nothing when
 * there is none, so a solo user never sees the chrome.
 *
 * The list is BOUNDED (`max-h-72`) and scrolls inside itself. The sidebar
 * header is a fixed, non-scrolling region above the nav, so an unbounded list
 * would push the navigation down and get clipped by the rail's
 * `overflow-hidden` — invitations you cannot reach. The bound is sized to TWO
 * WHOLE cards plus the top edge of a third: at the previous `max-h-52` the
 * second card was sliced through its own Accept / Decline row, which reads as a
 * rendering fault rather than "scroll for more" (macOS overlay scrollbars show
 * nothing until you scroll). A clipped card TOP is the affordance; nothing here
 * is hover-gated, and no invite is ever hidden behind a "show more" the user
 * has to discover.
