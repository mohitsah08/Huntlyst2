/**
 * The phone's header for a DRILLED screen — a team's section, the team's
 * settings level, a focused agent.
 *
 * A different grammar from the desktop strip on purpose, and it is the level
 * above, not this header, that carries the difference. On the phone the
 * section was already chosen one level up (the AI Employees list, or an
 * employee's task list menu), so a
 * switcher here would offer the same list twice and leave the screen without a
 * title. What a drilled phone screen owes instead is the two things a lozenge
 * cluster cannot say at 375px: where you ARE (a real `<h1>`, the subject and
 * its section) and how to get BACK.
 *
 * The back control is a floating round chip rather than a labelled lozenge:
 * the destination is named by the tab the user is standing in, and a chip
 * leaves the whole row to the title. Its `aria-label` names the destination, so
 * the affordance is never just an arrow to a screen reader.
 *
 * Presentational only — every caller passes its own words and its own retreat.
