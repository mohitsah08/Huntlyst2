 * Deliberately below the shared `CATALOG_INSTALLED_PREVIEW_CAP` (6): that cap
 * was tuned for the ~56px rows the skills and integrations strips show, and a
 * connected provider row now measures 136px because it carries the account's
 * meters. `CatalogGrid` is single-column below `lg`, so six would be ~820px of
 * strip between the hero and the discovery tabs — the tabs would open below the
 * fold on a laptop. Three is ~416px there (and ~276px in the two-column layout),
 * which keeps "Connected" and the tabs on screen together; the "Show all"
 * expander, and searching (which uncaps), reach the rest.

/**
 * The hub's consolidated "Connected" strip in the catalog ROW grammar the
 * browse lists use: every connected AI provider as a flat catalog row — the
 * full-color brand mark, the provider name, one muted line naming how it is
 * connected, and, underneath, that account's LIVE usage (plan, rate-limit
 * meters, prepaid balance or metered spend). Usage has no separate surface: an
 * account and how much of it is left are one thing, so they render as one row
 * (HOU-789). The row BODY opens that provider's detail modal (sign-out and its
 * model list live there). It sits OUTSIDE the discovery tabs (identity, not
 * discovery).
 *
 * The page's ONE search field narrows this strip: the parent passes the already
 * matched `providers` (and omits the whole section when a live query matches
 * none), so the strip owns only its own usage fetch. At rest it shows at most
 * {@link CONNECTED_PREVIEW_CAP} rows behind a "Show all" expander so a
 * well-stocked strip never buries the tabs; while `searching` every match shows
 * uncapped (searching IS looking past the preview).
 *
 * The strip is the "yours" side, so it also carries the providers whose probe
 * could not be confirmed (HOU-979): they belong with the user's accounts rather
 * than in the browse tab's connect-me list, but they must NOT borrow the green
 * Connected dot. Each row reads its own state and shows the pending dot instead
 * — honest, and still no Connect CTA anywhere on this strip. An unconfirmed row
 * also shows no usage tier at all, and its presence never triggers the fetch:
 * Houston makes no metering claim about an account it could not read.
