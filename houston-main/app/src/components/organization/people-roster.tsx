/**
 * The People roster: one row per member with an avatar, name/email, and a role.
 * Owners get a role dropdown and a confirm-gated Remove for everyone but
 * themselves; admins see those read-only. Other OWNER rows are editable too
 * (multi-owner orgs), with two confirm gates: removing anyone, and granting
 * owner (full org authority). Demoting/removing a sole owner is refused by the
 * gateway's `last_owner` 409, surfaced as a plain informational toast. The role
 * Select and Remove disable while their mutation is in flight. This is
 * membership only: a person's per-agent access is read on that agent's own
 * settings screen, so a row's identity is not a drill-in here. A face on the
 * org chart opens this roster on that person (`usePersonFocus`).
