/**
 * The ONE person row Houston lists people with: a face, a name (plus a quiet
 * "you" marker on the caller's own row), an optional second identity line, and
 * exactly ONE trailing control on the right.
 *
 * The Permissions agent People tab renders it, and any other list of people
 * renders the same shell, because a fork is how two lists of people start
 * reading differently. The shell owns the flat
 * page language (transparent row, no card chrome, so the section's own rhythm
 * carries the list) and the identity typography; it knows nothing about teams,
 * agents or access levels, which is what keeps it reusable for the next list.
 *
 * The trailing control is the caller's `children`: a dropdown, a static label,
 * whatever that surface's one decision is. A control that opens a menu should
 * wear {@link personRowTriggerClass} so every people list's right edge is the
 * same pill at every width.
