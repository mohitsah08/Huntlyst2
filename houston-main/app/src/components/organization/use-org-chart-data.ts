/**
 * Everything the org chart draws, read and ranked. Time worked is read only
 * where the deployment serves it; message usage only for owners and admins
 * (the gateway serves nobody else). Both queries park themselves while Admin
 * is off screen (`useAdminScreenActive`), and a read that never landed stays
 * `loading`, so nothing is drawn from data that is not there. Each read is
 * rolled up once per answer, against the day it landed on, so a figure and
 * its chart always count the same window.
