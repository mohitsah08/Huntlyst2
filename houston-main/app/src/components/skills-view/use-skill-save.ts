 * The skill editor's save + delete flow, split out for the file law, for ONE
 * employee's Skills section. A store skill's save is one store write; a copy's
 * save rewrites this employee's copy and no one else's. Delete removes this
 * employee's copy, behind a confirm; deleting a skill for EVERY employee is the
 * menu's own act (`use-workspace-skill-acts.tsx`). Failures are already toasted
 * by the `call` wrapper, so the catches here add no second message; they
 * report the rejection so a failed write is never silent to US, and the
 * surface stays open so the user can retry.
 *
 * `onSaved` and `onDeleted` are separate because the editor stays on the skill
 * it just saved and only leaves once the skill is gone.
