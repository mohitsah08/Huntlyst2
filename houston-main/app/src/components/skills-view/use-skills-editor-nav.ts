 * rows every render, so a skill the agent renames or re-assigns under the
 * editor stays in step.
 *
 * Entering the editor also opens that skill's chat on the right, which is
 * where the editing actually happens; closing the chat leaves the editor up,
 * and the host's "Open chat" pill mounts it again. On a phone the panel COVERS
 * the content, so the chat waits for that pill rather than burying the editor
