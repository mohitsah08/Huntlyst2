/**
 * The way out of a guided beat, worn by the beat's OWN surface.
 *
 * It rides the card it closes rather than standing in a fixed corner of the
 * window: the surface moves (a lesson's whisper follows its target across the
 * screen), and a detached chip both drifts onto the app's real controls and
 * falls outside the card's `aria-modal` scope, where a screen reader can never
 * reach it. Inside the dialog it is simply the dialog's close.
 *
 * The house close idiom, from `ui/core`'s dialog: same corner, same 16px icon
 * on a quiet hover plate, same muted-to-ink shift. Callers pass `className` to
 * seat it in their own geometry (a `p-8` card insets it further than a compact
 * chip does).
