/**
 * The install press of "From a friend" as an ORDER of steps, with no React in
 * it: refuse an unusable name, run the round-trip, then reveal the agent.
 * `use-import-install-action.ts` supplies the effects and wraps this in the
 * same-tick latch.
 *
 * Kept apart from the hook so the press is drivable in a plain test — a rage
 * burst making exactly ONE round-trip is the behaviour that matters here, and
 * a React-free action is what lets a test prove it.
