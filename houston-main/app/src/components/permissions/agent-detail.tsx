/**
 * Permissions agent detail: an org owner/admin opens ONE agent on the canonical
 * {@link AgentSettingsPage} — its Context (job description, learnings) and its
 * Permissions (people, apps, AI models, skills) in one master-detail surface.
 * The whole product is agent-centric: pick an agent, then manage who reaches it
 * and what it may reach.
 *
 * Configuring an agent is a MANAGER's job and the page has one door — the
 * agent's own Settings section, which only its managers are offered
 * (`visibleAgentSections`). So everyone standing here manages this agent, and
 * every section renders its editable face. The gateway is the real enforcer.
 *
 * The `agent` is resolved live from the store by the shell (by id, not a
 * snapshot), so a share mutation that reloads the store shows fresh data here.
 *
 * The agent's Share affordance lives in the People section (it is the invite
 * door), so this shell carries navigation and the body registry, nothing else.
