 *
 * Finishing never waits on a failure. The import is reported and stays owed
 * on this device, and {@link useOwedTranscriptRetry} sends it on the next load.
 *
 * A conversation finishes once: a second `done` (a double press, an ending
 * that finishes on its own) is ignored. `then` runs once the conversation is
 * saved, right before the view is handed over. A finish pressed while the
 * manager's address is still being discovered waits for discovery to answer,
 * so the conversation is not lost to a slow first load.
