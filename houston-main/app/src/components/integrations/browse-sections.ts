 * Committed data on purpose, NOT the live API sort. Composio's toolkits
 * endpoint DOES expose a usage sort (`GET /api/v3/toolkits?sort_by=usage`,
 * verified 2026-07-22 — it is also the endpoint's default order), but it ranks
 * by usage across Composio's whole customer base, which is developers: its top
 * ten includes github, supabase and perplexityai — exactly the apps this
 * catalog's curated ordering exists to bury for our audience (see
 * `category-priority.ts`). Membership therefore stays hand-picked, while the
 * ORDER follows those same apps' relative ranks from that verified usage data,
 * so the section is honestly "most used" without the developer-heavy tail.
 *
 * These are Composio toolkit slugs (lowercase, no separators); matched
 * case-insensitively and any that aren't in the live catalog simply drop out.
 * Order here IS the display order (curated, not A-Z). The trailing numbers are
 * each app's rank in Composio's usage-sorted catalog on 2026-07-22.
