/**
 * The ONE app-logo component, shared by every integrations surface (tab, sheet,
 * catalog rows) AND the in-chat connect cards. Span-based so it nests validly
 * inside inline chat prose (the RowCard badge lives inside a <p>), while the
 * flex classes render identically in block contexts.
 *
 * States: the brand image renders BARE (its own art carries the brand — no
 * plate, no border, so it integrates into whatever surface hosts it); the
 * initial-letter fallback (no URL, or the image failed) keeps a soft
 * `bg-input` plate so the letter reads as a deliberate avatar. The box is
 * a fixed size in every state, so swapping never shifts surrounding layout.
 *
 * The failure latch is keyed to the URL that actually failed: a card that
 * mounts before the toolkits catalog resolves (the in-chat connect step) shows
 * the letter for its interim state, then AUTOMATICALLY retries when the real
 * catalog `logoUrl` arrives. A boolean latch here once ate the production
 * logos: the pre-catalog favicon guess 404'd, latched, and the real Composio
 * logo landing moments later was never rendered.
 *
 * The image loads lazily and decodes off the main thread: the grouped catalog
 * mounts hundreds of rows at once, so offscreen logos must not fire their
 * network fetch eagerly and stall the first paint.
