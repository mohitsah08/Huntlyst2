 *
 *  - `poll`        — one connection-status call (already routed through
 *                    `call()`, so a network failure rejects here).
 *  - `sleep`       — the inter-attempt delay. Back it with a `Waker` (below) to
 *                    let `checkNow()` wake the loop before the interval elapses.
 *  - `isCancelled` — read before every wait + poll so cancelling stops the loop
 *                    immediately instead of running out the full budget.
 *
 * Returns `"active"` on success, `"error"` if the OAuth failed or was revoked,
 * `"cancelled"` if the flow was cancelled mid-wait, `"gone"` when the
 * connection no longer exists (its read answers 404), and `"timeout"` once the
 * attempt budget is spent while still pending. A 404 landing on a poll that was
 * ALREADY cancelled (the user's own disconnect raced the in-flight read) is
 * the cancel, not a second outcome. Any other poll failure still rejects so
