/**
 * A compact row of 16px toolkit logos: the apps a card's subject works with
 * (a first-party agent in the new-agent store, a skill in the picker / chat /
 * installed strip). Purely informational: the user connects apps once on the
 * Integrations page (Composio), and every skill reaches them through the
 * integration tools.
 *
 * Logos resolve through the Composio toolkit catalog (the same `appDisplay`
 * path as the Integrations page), because the favicon guess alone breaks for
 * every slug that isn't literally a `.com` domain (googledocs, metaads,
 * perplexityai, ...). While the catalog hasn't loaded — or on a deployment
 * with no integration provider wired — `appDisplay` falls back to the guess,
 * and {@link AppLogo} carries the per-URL failure latch so a pip that showed
 * its letter for the interim guess still upgrades when the real logo lands.
 *
 * Each pip carries the app's REAL name as its tooltip, never the machine slug.
