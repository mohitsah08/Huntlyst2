 * confirm-gated disconnect. The open sheet is re-resolved against the LIVE
 * connection by the exact id the user opened — a toolkit can hold more than one
 * account (an active login beside a leftover pending one), so keying by toolkit
 * would resolve the wrong row; a disconnect elsewhere then drops it and closes.
 * Requesting a disconnect also closes the sheet so the two never stack.
