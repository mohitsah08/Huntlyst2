/**
 * The connect / reconnect hand-off. It binds this surface to the ONE shared
 * flow state (`stores/connect-flow.ts`) rather than owning a private copy, so:
 *
 *  - per-toolkit single-flight holds across every surface within one SCOPE — a
 *    second caller for the same app JOINS the running flow and observes its
 *    outcome, so a chat card and the Integrations page share one hand-off when
 *    they ask on behalf of the same caller. The scope is the agent the connect
 *    is for, or the account when there is none (`connect-flow-scope.ts`): an
 *    account-scoped link is minted WITHOUT an agent, so the gateway never
 *    consults that agent's app allowlist, and an agent's card must never be
 *    answered by one. Each scope also reads only its own live rows;
 *  - flows are PER TOOLKIT and genuinely concurrent — connecting Slack never
 *    disables Notion's row, on this surface or any other;
 *  - leaving a surface no longer cancels anything. The poll belongs to the
 *    user's intent, not to a mounted component; only an explicit Cancel stops
 *    it, and the ~5 minute attempt budget caps an abandoned one.
 *
 * Each live connect owns one registry entry (waker, cancel flag, redirect URL,
 * its run) plus one key in the shared `states` record; when it settles it leaves
 * a self-expiring `notices` entry so the row the user clicked confirms in place.
 * `checkNow`/`reopen`/`cancel` address exactly one toolkit.
 *
 * Every engine call routes through `call()` (toasts + reports failures); the
 * outcomes it cannot see are surfaced here, ONCE, for every surface: a landed
 * connection (success toast), an abandoned OAuth (neutral toast pointing at the
 * pending row's Finish action, NOT a crash report) and a provider-side failure
 * (error toast, no auto bug report). A cancel is silent by design.
