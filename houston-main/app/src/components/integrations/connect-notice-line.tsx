/**
 * ONE settled connect outcome as a single quiet line.
 *
 * The words are deliberately short. The TOAST is the full announcement — it has
 * to be, it is the only one that still reaches a user who navigated away — so
 * repeating the same sentence on the row said one thing three times over. What
 * belongs here is the state: "Connected", "Could not connect". The abandoned
 * case keeps its sentence because it is the actionable one: it says the app can
 * be connected again, right where it sits. A connection that vanished under
 * the poll (`cancelled`) has NO toast at all: the user disconnected it
 * themselves, or the provider let it lapse, so this quiet line is the one
 * surface (PRODUCT-1733).
 *
 * Lives apart from {@link ConnectFlowInline} so a surface can show the outcome
 * without pulling in the whole live-phase block.
