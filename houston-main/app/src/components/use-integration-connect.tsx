/**
 * The reactive connect logic behind BOTH in-chat connect surfaces — the inline
 * markdown-link {@link IntegrationConnectCard} (a passive badge in assistant
 * prose) and the stepper's connect step ({@link ChatConnectInteractionCard},
 * an identity row with a footer CTA). Extracted so the two render shapes never
 * duplicate the status subscription, the OAuth hand-off, or the already-
 * connected self-report; only their presentation differs.
 *
 * The returned `app` is display-ready: its `name` is always a human label (the
 * catalog name, or a prettified slug on a catalog miss — never the raw
 * "googlesheets" string), and its `logoUrl` stays EMPTY until the toolkits
 * catalog has settled. Both surfaces render it through the shared `AppLogo`
 * (the Integrations page's component), whose letter fallback covers the interim.
 * Racing an `<img>` against the still-loading catalog is exactly what ate the
 * production logos: the favicon-guess fallback 404'd first and its error state
 * shadowed the real Composio logo that resolved moments later.
 *
 * The card owns its own connection status (it subscribes to the shared
 * integration queries directly) so it stays reactive inside Streamdown's
 * memoized markdown blocks: a parent-computed prop would freeze at first
 * render and never reflect a connection that lands afterwards. TanStack
 * dedupes the fetches, so N cards still issue one request per tick.
