/**
 * The first-run onboarding's lifecycle and funnel, for the component that
 * stays mounted across its three steps (`ManagerOnboardingHost`, around the
 * shell, whatever screen the person is on):
 *
 * - START ({@link startFirstRun}): a run that is not already pending records
 *   the `"started"` stage of `onboarding_pending` and reports
 *   `onboarding_started`; every mount arms `first_message_sent` for the
 *   account. The stage is the resume contract: hiring the first AI Employee
 *   flips the zero-agent first-run signal, so without it the user would be
 *   dropped out of onboarding before finishing their team.
 * - TEAM LATCH: the team step on screen records the `"team"` stage, so the
 *   run stays on it even if the AI provider drops while it hires.
 * - FUNNEL: each step shown reports its step view once, and leaving the
 *   connect step reports `ai_provider_connected` ({@link onboardingBeats}).
 * - FINISH (the returned callback, the conversation's last answer): reports
 *   `onboarding_completed`, clears the pending stage and stamps
 *   `onboarding_completed`. Both flags flip their query caches synchronously,
 *   so the same render routes into the app.
 *
 * `shown` is the step on display, or null while one is still loading, so a
 * step is never reported before the user can see it.
