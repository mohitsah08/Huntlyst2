 * What the action row offers on each screen.
 *
 * On a question, a catalog pick answers it outright, so Continue only appears
 * while a PICKED answer is held: the industry the survey preselected, or an
 * answer the person came Back to. A typed answer carries its own Continue in
 * its row, and a second one down here would be two buttons for one thing.
 *
 * Hire never waits on the host (the roster creates behind the person). Done
 * is the one press that can: it waits for hires still on their way, and is
 * held while one that failed still needs a Retry or letting go.
