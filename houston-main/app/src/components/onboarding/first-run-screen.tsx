/**
 * The shared full-screen layout for every pre-app surface (the language gate,
 * sign-in, the migration reconnect and the cloud-migration wizard). A flat,
 * calm page: the app's light-mode gutter grey (`bg-gutter`, the same tone the
 * sidebar melts into) under white cards, no space photo, no glass.
 *
 * `data-theme="light"` is pinned so these surfaces read as a bright light page
 * even for a dark-mode user (the pre-workspace flow is deliberately always
 * light), and so every `--ht-*` token inside resolves to its light value
 * regardless of the app theme. A `z-10` content slot floats on
 * top; children never need to re-declare the stacking. The slot is `min-h-0`
 * so a screen taller than a short phone viewport scrolls INSIDE its card
 * instead of growing the slot past the `h-dvh` frame and off the screen.
