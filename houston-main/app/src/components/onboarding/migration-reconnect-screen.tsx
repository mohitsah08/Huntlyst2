 * The connect flow is the SAME `<ProviderBrowser>` used in onboarding and the
 * AI Hub — it owns the OAuth launch, the device-code / login dialogs, the
 * status polling, and the failure toasts (no silent failures), and fires
 * `onSelect` the instant a provider connects. We react to that by persisting
 * the "seen" flag and dismissing; the App-level gate then falls through to the
 * normal shell. `selectOnMount` finishes the moment we detect an
 * already-connected provider on the first status snapshot too.
