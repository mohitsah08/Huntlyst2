/**
 * Pure activity-override resolution for a Mission Control follow-up send.
 *
 * Mission Control is cross-agent: an existing activity's stored provider+model
 * is the per-activity override and is often different from the agent's default
 * (e.g. agent default is GPT-5.5 but the activity was created with Opus). The
 * engine's session router never reads activity records — it falls back to the
 * agent's `config.json` when no override is passed. So the frontend must look
 * up the activity and forward its provider+model on every send; otherwise the
 * picker shows one model while the wire ships another, surfacing as a silent
 * model swap when both CLIs are installed, or as `Failed to spawn <cli>:
 * program not found` when they aren't.
 *
 * Kept pure (no React, no Tauri, no async) so the lookup + legacy-alias
 * normalization is unit-testable and shared with whatever Mission Control's
 * future send paths grow into.
