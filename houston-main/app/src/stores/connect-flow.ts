/**
 * The ONE connect-flow state for the whole app.
 *
 * Every surface that can start an OAuth hand-off (the Integrations page, the
 * in-chat connect cards, onboarding, the automation intake) used to own a
 * private registry, so a connect started in chat was invisible on the
 * Integrations page and the same app could be handed off twice at once.
 * Lifting both halves here fixes that:
 *
 *  - {@link connectFlowRegistry} — the render-independent half (waker, cancel
 *    flag, redirect URL, the run's promise), a module singleton so per-toolkit
 *    single-flight holds ACROSS surfaces and a poll outlives the surface that
 *    started it. Navigating away no longer cancels anything: only the user's
 *    explicit Cancel does, and the poll is capped at ~5 minutes
 *    (`POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS`) so an abandoned flow can never leak forever.
 *  - the store below — the render half every surface subscribes to.
