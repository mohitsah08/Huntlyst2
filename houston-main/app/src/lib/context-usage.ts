 *
 * A `provider_switched` divider RESETS both the fill and the peak: a mid-session
 * provider switch starts a fresh context window on a DIFFERENT provider, and
 * usage observed under the previous provider says nothing about the new one's
 * window. Without the reset, a large peak under one provider (e.g. an Opus 1M
 * conversation) bleeds into the next provider's window estimate and wrongly
 * snaps it up (e.g. GPT-5.5's 258k default jumping to its opt-in-1M 950k
 * ceiling), so the indicator reads a wrong window and a tiny percentage.
 * `context_compacted` is NOT a reset: it's the same provider, so the
 * pre-compaction peak still proves that provider's window.
 *
 * `context_cleared` resets the FILL only: the user emptied the model's context,
 * so the gauge must read empty again, but the same provider is still in play
 * and its observed peak still proves its window.

 * when the model has no catalogued window, so the caller falls back to a raw
 * token count.
 *
 * The result is floored at the observed peak, so even a mis-catalogued ceiling
 * can't make the indicator read over 100% — that guarantee lives here in the
 * data layer, with the component's clamp as defense in depth.
 *
 * The snap-up rule here is mirrored by `effectiveModelWindow` in
 * `@houston/protocol`, which the runtime's autocompact uses — same table of
 * `{ default, max }` numbers (see `getContextWindowConfig`), same math, so the
