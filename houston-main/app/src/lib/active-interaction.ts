/**
 * The one interaction the open conversation is waiting on the user for, or
 * null. Drives the composer-replacing card (see `useAgentChatPanel`) and the
 * differentiated completion notification.
 *
 * Two sources, in priority order:
 *  1. `live` — the SDK conversation VM's `pendingInteraction`, set when THIS
 *     client settled the turn on an `ask_user` / `request_connection`.
 *  2. `persisted` — the activity's `pending_interaction`, the reload/observer
 *     case: a client that never saw the live `done` frame reads the interaction
 *     the engine stamped onto the board card.
 *
 * The override is shown ONLY when no turn is running: a fresh turn clears the
 * VM interaction (running + null) the instant it starts, so returning null
 * while `running` makes the card disappear through the same reactivity the
 * turn start already drives — no separate teardown.
 *
 * `missionStatus` is the board status of the mission this conversation belongs
 * to, and it applies the SAME strip rule the write seams apply: on `done` the
 * blocking steps are void (the user's move to Done answered them) and only the
 * clean-finish offers keep rendering. It has to be applied HERE too, because
 * only the persisted side gets rewritten by that move: the VM's
 * `pendingInteraction` is written at turn start/settle and a board write never
 * touches it, so without this a Done card kept showing the live question
 * stepper until an app reload. Live and reload must agree.
 *
 * Every other status (`needs_you`, `error`, `running`, `archived`, unknown) is
 * untouched: only Done is the user answering the mission.

 * (they must not reset while the user walks the steps), and the per-step offer
 * dismissal chains its writes on it (a fresh object mid-sequence would restart
 * the chain and resurrect an already-dismissed offer). The strip runs on the
 * LIVE interaction, which a dismissal does not rewrite, so it would otherwise
 * re-mint a new object every time the persisted side changed underneath it.
