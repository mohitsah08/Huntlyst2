/**
 * Mission creation that answers the instant the user sends (PRODUCT-1643).
 *
 * The normal `createMission` awaits the board row's read-modify-write before
 * starting the turn. Against an asleep hosted pod every per-agent request is
 * held for the whole cold start, so the composer froze with the user's text
 * still in it and no bubble for seconds — read as a dead send button. The
 * asleep check (HOU-730) only routes to the warming queue once it has
 * concluded, and never for a pod that fell asleep while the chat stayed open.
 *
 * This path needs nothing from the pod before the message is on screen:
 *
 *  1. The activity id is generated client-side (the host honors it, HOU-693)
 *     and the board-row POST fires without being awaited — an id-upsert, so
 *     it lands whenever the pod answers.
 *  2. The turn starts right away: the turn stream pushes the user's bubble
 *     synchronously and the thinking indicator takes over, while the wire
 *     send rides the same gateway hold as the row write.
 *
 * The caller gets the id/sessionKey back immediately, so the panel opens on
 * the new conversation with the message visible. A row is not a precondition
 * for a turn (a turn with no card is a transient session); the turn's own
 * status writes match the row by session key once it has landed.
