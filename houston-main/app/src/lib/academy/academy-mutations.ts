// The ONE way an Academy record is ever changed.
//
// A record is a read-modify-write over two stores, and it is written from three
// unrelated places: a finished lesson, a running lesson's saved position, and
// the usage economy's flush. Left to themselves they interleave — two of them
// load the same record and the second one saves over the first's write, which
// is a lesson award or an afternoon of points silently gone. So every mutation
// queues here instead, per account, and each one loads afresh inside its own
// slot.
//
// Storage-agnostic: `./academy-ports.ts` supplies the live ports and the
// install id, so all of this is driven from `app/tests` with no engine.
