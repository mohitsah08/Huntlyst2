 *
 * The pipeline is SEQUENTIAL and resumable, NOT independently retryable calls:
 *   pick-or-create team -> confirm -> move (poll to terminal) -> switch active
 *   space to the team -> invite teammates -> done.
 *
 * PIPELINE ORDER IS LAW (contract §Share-triggers-team): a teammate invite
 * (`addOrgMember`) must NEVER fire before the move reaches `done`. Inviting
 * earlier is what could start a trial on a team whose agent move then fails.
 * {@link assertInviteReady} encodes that rule for the wiring layer, and the
 * only transition that produces the `invite` step is a completed switch, which
 * is itself only reachable from a `done` move poll.
