 * manager vs user. The caps-only org gates (create / see-members / billing / org

 *
 * - Single-player (no org): always true — the sole user owns everything.
 * - Multiplayer `owner`: always true (owner manages every org agent).
 * - Otherwise: the caller's effective `access` on this agent is `"manager"`.
 *
 * Purely trusts `agent.access`: the gateway already CLAMPS access to the org
 * role at read/enforcement time, so a role-`user` never carries an effective
 * `access="manager"` on the wire (a stale `manager` row is clamped away before
 * it reaches the client). The client therefore does not re-clamp by role —
 * `access` is already effective. Admins are NOT auto-managers of agents they
 * merely use; they must hold `access="manager"` (matrix v2 dropped the admin
