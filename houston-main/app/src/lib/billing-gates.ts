 * — whether the ACTIVE space bills at all — and because that file had grown
 * past the size limit. Same contract as its siblings: cosmetic gates only, the
 * gateway is the sole enforcer, and these merely hide affordances the caller
 * could not act on. Unit-tested in `app/tests/org-roles.test.ts`.

 * an admin sees the summary (this gate) but cannot checkout (owner-only write) —
 * the client shows admins the same "ask the owner to upgrade" copy, just better
 * informed. Single-player has no billing, so `null` role is denied here (unlike
