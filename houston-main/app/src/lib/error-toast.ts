 * copy-the-code action. Both are gone. A generic red box a non-technical user
 * cannot act on, followed by a Sentry event id that means nothing to them, cost
 * more in alarm than it bought in information — and the errors that a user CAN
 * act on (a name that's already taken, no microphone, an expired trial) never
 * came through here: they have authored copy at their own call sites, and they
 * still toast exactly as before. So do the informational states
 * (`showConnectivityErrorToast`, `showEngineWakingToast`) above.
 *
 * NOTE this is a deliberate, scoped exception to the repo's no-silent-failures
 * beta policy: silent to the USER, never silent to us. Every reporting path is
 * untouched, so the failure still reaches:
 *   - the frontend log, via the `console.error` below (mirrored to the log file
 *     and bundled into a Report-bug submission);
 *   - PostHog, via `app_error_shown` (the event name is kept despite nothing
 *     being shown, so the existing error-rate dashboards stay continuous);
 *   - Sentry, via `captureException` with `command` as the triage tag.
 * Losing the toast means losing the user-reported half of a bug report, which
 * makes those three the whole signal — do not quiet them too.
 *
 * `command` is a short machine-readable tag (e.g. "list_workspaces",
 * "uncaught_error") used as the Sentry tag for triage.
