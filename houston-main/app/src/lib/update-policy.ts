/**
 * Update policy model (pure logic; `useUpdateChecker` + the surfaces consume it).
 *
 * A release is never installed out from under a working user. The updater
 * finds a release in one of two moments, and the moment decides the shape:
 *
 * - `launch` — the launch check found it. Nothing is running yet, so the
 *   install runs right away behind a calm "upgrading Houston" overlay and the
 *   app relaunches into the new version. This is what keeps the fleet fresh:
 *   every update lands on the next app open at the latest. The launch check
 *   is the first check of the app PROCESS (`update-launch-claim.ts`), never
 *   the first check of a hook mount: React remounts the updater with
 *   `<App/>` on every identity change, and that must not re-arm it.
 * - `poll` — a background re-check found it mid-session. The release
 *   downloads silently; nothing is shown until it is on disk. Then a small
 *   "Restart to update" pill sits in the window corner and the user restarts
 *   whenever they like. Nothing else ever triggers that install: no countdown,
 *   no modal, no auto-relaunch. A turn in flight, a draft being typed, a
 *   co-located engine mid-task: none of it can be killed by the updater.
 *
 * Detection stays pull-based: the Tauri updater polls the release feed's
 * manifest. There is no push channel to a desktop build, and no server-side
 * backstop either (the hosted gateway's 426 min-version floor was retired),
 * so freshness comes from cadence: a launch check, a short interval, and a
 * re-check when the window regains focus. That makes a client whose checks
 * keep FAILING (a proxy or region block between it and the release feed)
 * invisible and permanently stale, so consecutive check failures are counted
 * here and a stuck client surfaces itself: telemetry plus one visible "get it
 * manually" nudge per run.
