/**
 * WHAT HOUSTON GATHERS ABOUT PRODUCT USAGE — the rules around the table in
 * `catalogue-table.ts`. THIS file is the front door: everything else in the app
 * reads the table through here, never directly.
 *
 * The gateway's Postgres is the single source of truth for product analytics,
 * and the split between the two writers is deliberate:
 *
 *  - the SERVER writes every fact it can observe by itself (an account being
 *    minted, a conversation message it accepted, an account deletion). Those
 *    names are server-owned: the ingest route refuses them from a client, so a
 *    tampered or buggy app can never manufacture them.
 *  - the CLIENT sends only INTENT the server can never see — which answer was
 *    confirmed, which skill was invoked, which screen was opened. That is
 *    exactly that table, and nothing outside it leaves the device.
 *
 * PostHog is untouched and entirely separate: `analytics.track` still reports
 * to it from the same call sites, and this catalogue only decides which of
 * those beats ALSO ride the first-party pipe. Adding a name to the table is
 * the only way to gather something new — there are no other client event
 * sources.
