/**
 * Capture an error to Sentry WITHOUT showing a toast. For engine-call paths
 * that surface the failure with their own inline UI (a toast would be
 * redundant) but must still reach Sentry — the report is what lets us fix it.
 * Capture is decoupled from the toast so `{ toast: false }` callers aren't
 * silently invisible to crash reporting. Returns immediately; flush failures
 * are logged, never thrown.
 *
 * Two classes take the LOW-NOISE path instead of a per-event capture, both
 * expected environment states the engine-call layer already classifies:
 *  - transport-level network failures (device offline / host unreachable —
 *    HOU-1085; HOUSTON-APP-4PQ, PRODUCT-1383 was this layer's leak);
 *  - gateway waking answers (engine pod provisioning / restarting under a
 *    roll — HOU-1114, PRODUCT-1403; same one-layer-left failure mode as
 *    HOUSTON-APP-51C in the global rejection handler).
 * Declining them outright (the PRODUCT-1446 policy) kept deploy-day bursts
 * from filing hundreds of issues, but it also meant a raw gateway body a user
 * never saw existed only in their local log (PRODUCT-1640). They now capture
 * as a burst-collapsed warning in ONE fingerprinted issue per class, via
 * `reportQuietError`, which can never file a new issue per event.
