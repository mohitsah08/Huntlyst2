/**
 * What a background space-list refresh should do with a freshly-listed set
 * (the live-spaces poll, `useSpacesLiveRefresh`). Pure so the merge decision is
 * unit-tested without the store's engine/preference side effects — the store
 * applies the plan.
 *
 *  - `unchanged` — same spaces, same names: touch nothing (the common tick).
 *  - `update`    — the list changed but the active space survives: swap the
 *                  list in place, adopting the fresh current object so a
 *                  server-side rename of the active space shows too. No
 *                  re-pin, no cache reset — the active org is the same.
 *  - `reselect`  — the ACTIVE space vanished (the user was removed from that
 *                  team while the app was open): land on the default/first
 *                  space; the store must then re-pin the active org and reset
 *                  the space-scoped caches exactly like a user-driven switch —
 *                  staying pinned to a space the gateway now 403s would strand
 *                  every request.
