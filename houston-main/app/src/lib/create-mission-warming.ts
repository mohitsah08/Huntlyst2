/**
 * Mission creation while the agent's engine is still warming up (HOU-693).
 *
 * The normal `createMission` awaits the activity write before starting the
 * turn — against a warming engine that write is held for the whole cold
 * start, so the composer froze with the user's text still in it. This path
 * answers immediately instead:
 *
 *  1. Generate the activity id client-side (the host honors it, HOU-693) and
 *     fire the board-row POST without awaiting — it lands when the engine
 *     wakes, and the request itself nudges the warm-up along.
 *  2. Render the user's message as a local bubble and QUEUE the send with the
 *     provisioning entry (`lib/warming-sends.ts`). No held wire send: a held
 *     request dies with infrastructure timeouts or a reload, silently eating
 *     the message. The queued send fires when the readiness probe clears, and
 *     survives a relaunch via the entry's persisted mirror.
 *
 * The caller gets the id/sessionKey back right away, so the panel opens on
 * the new conversation with the message (and the in-flight indicator) visible.
