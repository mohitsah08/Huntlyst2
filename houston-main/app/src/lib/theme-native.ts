/**
 * The native window's theme, serialized.
 *
 * The window is ONE resource and `setTheme` has no ordering of its own: the calls
 * cross the Tauri IPC and can land in either order, so picking System and then
 * Dark could leave the window following the OS — the System release landing last
 * — while the preference and the DOM both read Dark. That is not a cosmetic
 * title-bar glitch: the webview derives `prefers-color-scheme` from the window
 * (see `./theme-boot`), so the mismatch is what makes the app answer the OS
 * appearance under an explicit mode, and the reverse leaves `system` wearing the
 * last mode that was pinned.
 *
 * So the window is driven through a single slot: the calls run one after
 * another, and an intent the slot no longer holds is dropped before it reaches
 * the window. The newest intent is the only one that can win.
 *
 * The window itself is the caller's to reach (`./theme-apply`), which is what
 * keeps this module free of Tauri and drivable by a fake in tests.
