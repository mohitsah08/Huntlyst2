 *  - `stepper` — anything else with at least one non-plan_ready step → the
 *                existing ChatInteractionCard, over the plan_ready-free steps
 *                (defensive: a plan_ready step never enters the stepper).
 *  - `none`    — a lone plan_ready step the user dismissed,
 *                or nothing renderable → the composer returns.
 *
 * `dismissed` is the summary of the plan_ready step the user dismissed. It
 * only suppresses a matching offer during the current idle
 * window; the panel clears it when a new turn starts, so reused step ids and
 * summaries never suppress a later turn's card. Pure so the branch is
 * unit-tested without the panel's event plumbing.
