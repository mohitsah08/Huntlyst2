/**
 * Hiring an AI Employee with no screen attached: create it, born with its
 * provider/model pin and its first day pending. It joins the sidebar as a
 * top-level employee; grouping it is the person's own arrangement. The
 * create dialog and any flow that hires on the user's behalf share it; what to
 * show afterwards (opening the board) stays with the caller.
 *
 * The pin and the pending first day ride the create itself, so they exist the
 * moment the employee does: nothing is left to write after a hosted pod
 * wakes, or to land on a folder a rename already moved. The first day never
 * starts here. It waits for the user's own click (`agent-first-day.ts`).
