/**
 * Whether the AI account a routine will RUN ON is usable — answered BEFORE any
 * run, not after one fails (PRODUCT-1475).
 *
 * A routine has no composer to fail in front of: it fires unattended, so the
 * only place its provider can be shown as broken is the screen where it is
 * read and edited. This module is the single mapping from a probed
 * `ProviderStatus` to what that screen renders.
 *
 * WHOSE credential (the scope rule). `/providers` answers for the VIEWER's own
 * credential scope, while a fired routine runs on its CREATOR's. So the badge
 * is a claim the viewer's probe can only support for the viewer's OWN routines
 * — {@link viewerIsRoutineCreator} is the gate, and a routine someone else
 * created gets a neutral "runs on the creator's account" line instead of a
 * badge that would be answering a different question.
 *
 * `health` is richer than `authenticated` (a credential can be valid yet out of
 * credits) and is absent on engines that predate it, so the fallback below
 * reads exactly what every pre-PRODUCT-1475 surface read. `unreachable` is the
 * probe saying "I could not confirm", which renders as the neutral `checking`
 * — never as a healthy or a broken claim (the HOU-979 rule).
 *
 * WHEN THE TWO DISAGREE, `authenticated` wins on the connected/not-connected
 * axis. While an agent's pod is asleep the gateway answers `/providers` from
 * the pod's LAST captured view with only `configured` (→ `authenticated`)
 * overlaid from the credential store; the captured `health` is whatever the
 * pod computed for whoever asked last, and in a team space that was often a
 * `not_connected` for a different member's scope. Reading `health` first
 * painted "Not connected" on every routine of an account whose chat picker
 * (which reads `authenticated`) said Connected, until the pod woke and the
 * proxied answer replaced the capture. `needs_reconnect` and `out_of_credits`
 * are kept: both describe a credential that IS present.
 *
 * Pure + DOM/i18n-free so every state is unit-tested without a renderer
 * (`app/tests/routine-provider-health.test.ts`).
