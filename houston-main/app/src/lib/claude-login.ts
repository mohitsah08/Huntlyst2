/**
 * Desktop Claude/Anthropic browser sign-in — the zero-terminal connect.
 *
 * Unlike the Codex relay (which binds a loopback and relays a code), Claude's
 * own `claude auth login` runs its ENTIRE flow on this machine: the native
 * `start_claude_login` command spawns the bundled `claude`, which opens the
 * browser, catches its own callback, and caches the credential in Houston's
 * shared login dir — the same `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` the engine reads. So there is
 * no code to relay and no runtime round-trip: the sign-in completes locally.
 *
 * Because it completes locally, there is no server `ProviderLoginComplete` to
 * ride. We synthesize one on the client bus (`publishLocalHoustonEvent`) once we
 * confirm the engine now reads the credential as connected, so every provider
 * surface (settings, picker, onboarding, reconnect card) reacts EXACTLY as it
 * does for a normal OAuth completion — flips the card, toasts, clears pending.
 *
 * TOPOLOGY: the SAME browser login runs on this machine for both a co-located
 * and a remote engine (`shouldUseClaudeDesktopLogin` is now any Tauri desktop).
 * What differs is WHERE the credential is minted and what happens AFTER
 * `claude-login://done` with success:
 *   * CO-LOCATED — the login caches into the shared dir the local runtime
 *     reads, so we only poll until the runtime reads it connected. That
 *     credential's refresh-token family stays local: the CLI is its only
 *     rotator, and it is NEVER pushed anywhere.
 *   * REMOTE (hosted pod) — the pod can't read this machine's Keychain, so the
 *     login mints into a throwaway HANDOFF dir, we EXTRACT the credential and
 *     PUSH it to the pod (see `claude-login-remote.ts`), destroy the local
 *     copy, then poll. From the push on, the gateway is that family's ONLY
 *     rotator (HOU-950 — a second rotator trips Anthropic's refresh-token-reuse
 *     detection and revokes the family, signing the user out everywhere). Any
 *     handoff failure surfaces as a standard error (Houston's infrastructure
 *     failed, not the user), never a dead spinner and never the token paste
 *     dialog; the paste flow is reserved for a helper that cannot RUN here.
 *
 * Each space the user connects therefore gets its OWN freshly minted token
 * family. There is deliberately NO path that seeds a space from a cached
 * credential snapshot: the old background reconcile did exactly that and was
 * how one family ended up behind several rotating stores (HOU-950 root cause).
