 * Boot-time cache of the last provider-status scan, keyed PER ACTIVE SPACE.
 *
 * Provider probes shell out to CLIs and can take seconds each (up to a 5s
 * timeout per provider), so the settings screen seeds its cards from this
 * snapshot and paints instantly; the live probe still runs and reconciles.
 * Same philosophy as the i18n locale flash-cache: localStorage is never the
 * source of truth, only a first-paint hint.
 *
 * The snapshot is scoped by the active space (C8) because provider connections
 * are tenant data — a team's connected providers differ from the personal
 * space's. A single global key (the old `.v1`) leaked one space's connected
 * cards into another on a switch (HOU-906), because the seed is a localStorage
 * read that the query-cache reset can't reach. Scoping the key by the active
 * org slug (personal ⇒ the fixed `"personal"` scope, resolved the same way the
 * engine adapter pins `x-houston-org` — `window.__HOUSTON_ACTIVE_ORG__`) makes
 * the seed self-scope: a switch reads the new space's own snapshot (or none).
