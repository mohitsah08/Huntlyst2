/**

 * - `openai`: pi's direct api-key `openai` provider collides with the
 *   `openai-codex → openai` rename (Houston surfaces the OAuth Codex provider
 *   under `openai`, not the raw API-key one).
 * - Retired cards (2026-07 provider QA): Ant Ling, the Kimi For Coding
 *   subscription (Kimi models surface under Moonshot AI instead), Moonshot AI's
 *   China deployment, and the three regional Xiaomi Token Plans. Dropping is
 *   presentation-only: the ids stay runnable on the wire, so an existing
 *   conversation pinned to one keeps working; they just can't be connected or
 *   picked anymore.
 * - Structurally unconnectable (2026-07 provider QA): both Cloudflare providers
 *   need the user's ACCOUNT ID (AI Gateway also a gateway id) baked into the
 *   request URL, so the single-pasted-key connect dialog can never verify or
 *   run them — every attempt dead-ends in "could not verify". Dropped until a
 *   multi-field connect ships (mapped follow-up); same presentation-only rules.
 *   (Azure OpenAI sat here briefly for the same reason; its connect dialog now
 *   collects the resource endpoint alongside the key — PRODUCT-1477.)
