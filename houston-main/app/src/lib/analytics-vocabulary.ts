/**
 * THE ANALYTICS VOCABULARY — every property that may ride a tracked event, and
 * the ones `cleanProps` keeps. The event names themselves are the sibling file
 * (`analytics-event-names.ts`), re-exported here so one import covers the whole
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * Split out of `analytics.ts` (which re-exports both unions, so no call site
 * changes) because this vocabulary is a contract several things read: the
 * first-party product catalogue types itself against it
 * (`product-analytics/catalogue-table.ts`), and the app's node tests assert
 * against it. Those readers must not drag PostHog and the engine adapter in,
 * which is exactly what importing `analytics.ts` costs — this file holds types
 * and one Set, and imports nothing but its sibling's type.
