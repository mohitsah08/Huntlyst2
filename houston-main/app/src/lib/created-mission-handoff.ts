/**
 * The handoff for a mission created OUTSIDE a board, to the board that is
 * about to open it.
 *
 * A board that creates its own mission remembers it on the spot
 * (`components/board/use-just-created-mission.ts`, wired through
 * `useMcOpenConversation`'s `rememberCreated`) so the panel it opens keeps a
 * session key and an agent path until the cross-agent sweep returns the row.
 * The agent's self-setup mission (`lib/agent-first-day.ts`) is opened from a
 * start button, by a module-level function that cannot reach that hook's setter —
 * so it opened the panel on a card nobody could name yet: null session key,
 * null agent path, a blank welcome chat until the sweep caught up. This module
 * is the missing wire: a module-level publisher, a hook that subscribes.
 *
 * The offer is READ, never claimed. Several mission boards are kept alive at
 * once (the global one and every visited team's), so a one-shot offer is taken
 * by whichever of them mounts first — measurably a HIDDEN one — and the board
 * on the glass stays blank, which is the bug. Letting them all adopt costs
 * nothing: the fallback only ever applies on the board whose selection IS that
 * mission, and each drops it the moment the real row lands.
 *
 * What keeps it from leaking is therefore the TTL: an offer nobody opened is
 * gone after `CREATED_MISSION_HANDOFF_TTL_MS` and can never surface as the
 * fallback for a LATER create. A new publish replaces the previous offer.
 *
 * Dependency-free (only a clock), so `node --test` exercises it directly.
