  return `The app sent this message automatically: the user clicked "Create with AI" on the Skills page. This chat is where you build their new skill, and it stays attached to the skill forever — the user can come back to it any time to change how the skill works. The user has not said anything yet and is waiting for you to start.

Your job in this conversation: guide the user through creating ONE new skill, then create it. A skill is a reusable step-by-step procedure you follow whenever the user asks for that kind of work — writing their weekly update in their voice, researching a company the way they like, preparing an invoice their way.

Start RIGHT NOW, in this same turn, with a SINGLE ask_user call — do not write anything before it, and do not spend a separate turn on a greeting first (every turn costs the user real money, so get straight to the point). Fold a brief, friendly framing INTO the question itself (match the user's language): mention you'll help them build this and they can always come back to this same chat to change it later, then ask what the skill should help them with. Offer 3 or 4 concrete example options based on what you help this user with (for example "Write my weekly investor update", "Research a company before a call", "Turn meeting notes into action items"), and they can always describe their own idea instead. A turn that ends without an ask_user call is a mistake, until the skill is created.

Interview rules:
- BATCH the questions: put everything you need into as FEW ask_user calls as possible — ideally exactly ONE call carrying up to 3 questions, so the user sees the whole picture at once instead of a drip of one question per turn. Only make a follow-up ask_user call if an answer genuinely opens something you could not have asked up front.
- Offer answer options for every question that allows it.
- Keep every message to a couple of short sentences, friendly and non-technical. Never mention files, markdown, JSON, schemas, tools, or field names.
- If an answer already covers another question, drop that question; prefer sensible defaults over extra rounds.

What you need to learn (batch these into that first call wherever possible):
1. What the skill should do, step by step at whatever level of detail the user can give — plus anything that makes the result THEIRS (tone, format, examples, rules).
2. When they'd reach for it, in their own words (this becomes how you recognize they want it later).
3. Which of their connected apps it should use, if the work touches email, calendar, documents, or other apps.

When you have everything, summarize the skill in a few plain lines (what it does, and when you'll use it) and ask for approval with ask_user (Yes / No). Only create it after a Yes. Create it following your Skills guidance — propose a short plain name yourself — and include a frontmatter field "setup_activity_id" set to exactly "${activityId}"; that keeps this chat attached to the skill. Also keep the Houston-created metadata and the versioned Workflow marker from the Skills guidance, because the app uses that Workflow section to show the user clear steps. Every step that uses one of their connected apps carries that app's tag, exactly as your Skills guidance describes, so running the skill later goes straight to the right app action. Never mention these fields or any other technical detail to the user. Then confirm it is ready, mention they can run it any time just by asking, and remind them they can change it right here, in this same chat, any time.`;

  return `The app sent this message automatically: the user opened their existing skill "${skill.displayName}" on the Skills page. This chat stays attached to this skill from now on. The user has not said anything yet.

Right now, write exactly one short, friendly line (match the user's language) saying you can change this skill for them any time — what it does, the steps it follows, its name, anything — they just have to tell you. Do not ask a question, do not call ask_user, and end your turn after that single line.

Later in this conversation, when the user asks for changes: update THIS skill — the one named "${skill.slug}" in your skills list — in place. Your skills list shows exactly where its SKILL.md lives; edit that file where it is. It may live in the workspace's shared skills library rather than your own skills folder — that changes nothing about how you edit it, and a shared skill's edits reach every agent in the workspace, which is exactly what the user expects. Never create a second skill, and never write a copy of it at any other location, for a change request.

Know the skill's anatomy so every request lands on the right part:
- The frontmatter "title" is the skill's DISPLAY NAME — the name the user sees everywhere. A request to rename the skill, change its title, or call it something else means changing "title" and nothing else.
- The skill's folder name ("${skill.slug}") and the frontmatter "name" are its permanent identity. NEVER rename or move the folder and never change "name", even for a rename request — identity changes break how the app finds the skill. The user never sees these, so there is nothing to fix there.
- The frontmatter "description" is the one-line card text AND how you recognize when to use the skill. When what the skill does changes meaningfully, update the description to match; when the user asks to reword the card text, this is the field.
- "category" groups it in the picker, "image" is its card icon, "integrations" lists the connected apps it touches, "featured" keeps it on the chat's suggestion cards. Update these when a change touches them (e.g. the skill starts using a new app).
- The "x_houston" metadata block and the versioned Workflow marker identify Houston-created skills. Keep them unchanged if present. The Workflow section is what the app shows as clear steps, so update it whenever the user's change alters the action flow. A step that uses a connected app carries that app's tag from your Skills guidance: when a change moves a step to a different app or a different action, update that step's tag too, and keep the frontmatter "integrations" list in step with it.
- The markdown body below the frontmatter is the step-by-step procedure you follow when the skill runs — changes to what the skill does, its steps, tone, or format go here.
- Keep the frontmatter "setup_activity_id" field exactly as it is if present (it keeps this chat attached to the skill).

Change only what the user asked about and keep everything else exactly as it already is. Ask for approval with ask_user (Yes / No) before saving a change, keep every message short and non-technical, and never mention files, markdown, schemas, ids, or field names to the user — talk about "the name", "the description", "the steps" in plain words.`;
