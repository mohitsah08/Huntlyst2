 * (`onboarding_language_selected`) fires from the language gate,
 * which sits ABOVE `<App/>` in the tree and blocks it from mounting until cleared.
 * When `analytics.init()` + `install_created` lived in App's mount effect they
 * fired AFTER those gate events, so the funnel broke at step 2 and every
 * downstream step reported 0. Running this at the very top of the tree (above
 * the gates) emits `install_created` first AND runs `posthog.identify(install_id)`
 * before any `onboarding_*` event, so all events share one identity from the
 * start.
 *
