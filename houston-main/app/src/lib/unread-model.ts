/**
 * Pure, DOM-free unread model (HOU-945): which missions have moved since I last

 *
 * Unread is defined against MY read floor ({@link readFloorFor}), never against
 * a server flag, so it stays correct with no write on every mission open and
 * degrades to the store's `since` for anything I have never opened.
 *
 * Relevance comes first, deliberately: in a team, a teammate's mission moving
 * is not news for me, and a sidebar that counts it teaches the user to ignore
 * the badge. A mission that @mentions me counts even though I never touched it
 * — the @mention IS the claim on my attention.

/**
 * Is this conversation unread FOR ME? Only relevant missions can be unread

 *
 * "No `selfId` is never unread" is the mirror image of relevance failing open:
 * with nobody signed in there is no per-person read state to compare against,
 * so an unread badge would be a number nobody could ever clear. Notifications
 * fail open because a missed ping is unrecoverable; a badge is not.
 *
 * TWO clocks, because the two signals are not the same claim:
 *
 * - An outstanding @MENTION of me wins outright, measured against my cursor for
 *   this conversation ALONE ({@link mentionReadFloorFor} — no `since` fallback).
 *   Someone typed my name; until I open the mission that is unread however old
 *   it is and whether or not I have ever touched it. Judging a mention by
 *   `updated_at` would also lose it the moment the mission moved on without me.
 * - Otherwise ambient movement: `updated_at` strictly after my read floor, which
 *   DOES fall back to `since` so a fresh device does not open on a backlog.
 *
 * Strictly-after (not at-or-after) so marking a mission read at the instant of
 * its own `updated_at` clears it, instead of leaving it stuck unread.
