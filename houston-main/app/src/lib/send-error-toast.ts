/**
 * The ONE toast for a send that failed BEFORE a turn stream existed
 * (attachment save, activity lookup, refused start): nothing wrote to the VM,
 * so this toast is the failure's only user-visible surface
 * (no-silent-failures rule). Shared by every pre-turn send catch so the
 * expected states below branch in one place instead of five.
 *
 * A stale attachment (see `isStaleAttachmentError`) is the user's disk
 * changing under an attached file, not a Houston bug: it gets authored,
 * actionable copy as a plain info toast — never the red box with a raw
 * DOMException, which reads as "Houston is broken" and gives no way out.
 * Sentry capture for it is silenced at the `save_attachments` call in
 * `tauri.ts`; the raw diagnostic still reaches the frontend log there.
 *
 * Every other failure shows authored copy only: the raw error (an
 * `EngineError` quoting an HTTP status, a JSON body, a cluster hostname) goes
 * to the frontend log and Sentry via `logAndReportError`, never into the toast.
