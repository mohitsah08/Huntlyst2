 * The setup chat behind every automation — its persistent conversation, the
 * whole tab screen while open (HOU-725, first-principles rebuild). Each item
 * gets exactly one: creating it starts the chat, and reopening it resumes the
 * very same conversation.
 *
 * One kind of chat serves both wake mechanisms (schedule and event trigger) —
 * the merged Automations tab replaced the old Routines/Reactions split. New
 * chats carry `ROUTINE_SETUP_AGENT_MODE`; the legacy reaction sentinel is
 * still RECOGNIZED (never written) so chats created before the merge keep
 * resolving. Board surfaces hide both via `isRoutineSetupMode`; the kickoff
 * prompts live in `routine-chat-prompts.ts`. This module owns the sentinels
 * and the chat <-> item link resolution.
 *
 * The chat <-> item link is stored in both directions — the item's
 * `setup_activity_id` (written by the agent on chat-created items, by the
 * client otherwise) and the activity's `routine_id` (client-stamped, durable
 * because agents never rewrite activity.json). See the resolution helpers below
 * for why one direction is not enough.
