/**
 * Remote-engine half of the desktop Claude browser sign-in.
 *
 * On a CO-LOCATED engine the credential `claude auth login` just cached IS the
 * dir the local runtime reads, so nothing is pushed. On a REMOTE/HOSTED engine
 * the pod can't read this machine's Keychain, so the login mints into a
 * throwaway HANDOFF dir; after `Login successful` the desktop EXTRACTS that
 * credential (`read_claude_credential`), PUSHES it to the pod over the control
 * plane, DESTROYS the local copy, then polls until the pod's runtime reads
 * anthropic as connected.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: Anthropic refresh tokens rotate — one family tolerates exactly
 * one rotator, and a second one trips reuse-detection and revokes the family
 * everywhere (HOU-950). So the freshly minted family is handed off
 * EXCLUSIVELY: once pushed, the gateway is its only holder, which is why the
 * handoff-dir copy is discarded the moment the push settles (success or
 * terminal failure). There is deliberately no path that re-pushes a cached
 * snapshot later — a failed handoff means the user reconnects from the card,
 * minting a new family.
 *
 * With NO agent selected (first-run onboarding, the cloud-migration wizard)
 * the push goes to the gateway's agentless SETUP runtime instead — same
 * central store, so the agents created or migrated right after are already
 * connected. Requiring a selected agent here was the bug that dumped every
 * pre-agent connect into the paste flow even though the browser login had
 * succeeded (HOU: "Finish signing in to Anthropic" during onboarding).
 *
 * The push RETRIES transient failures (engine 5xx, network) with backoff
 * before ever degrading — a waking pod or a momentary gateway blip must not
 * cost the user a manual token paste.
 *
 * SAFETY: this ships unsupervised, so EVERY user-initiated failure here
 * (extraction not-found, malformed cred, push non-200 after retries, network)
 * surfaces as a standard ERROR (toast with the report-bug affordance + Sentry
 * capture) — the user's browser login succeeded, so a failed handoff is
 * Houston's infrastructure failure, never a task handed back to the user (the
 * 2026-08-15 broken-image incident degraded every cloud connect into a "run
 * `claude setup-token`" dialog). A bug in the push must never leave the user
 * on a dead spinner either. And a push TRANSPORT failure alone is not proof
 * the credential didn't land (HOU-1143): before failing, the settlement
 * policy (`claude-login-settle`) asks the engine's own usability probe —
 * connected means connected. The token PASTE flow is reserved for the one
 * case where the LOCAL machine cannot run the browser login at all
 * (`fallbackToPaste`, pre-AVX2 helper — HOUSTON-APP-543).
