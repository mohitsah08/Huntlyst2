/**
 * The apply path: the ONE place a preference becomes what the user sees.
 *
 * Every path that changes the theme goes through {@link applyThemePreference},
 * so the DOM, the boot mirror (`./theme-boot`) and the native window chrome can
 * never drift from each other, and the OS-appearance watcher stays installed
 * exactly once. The preference itself is read and written in `./theme`, which
 * re-exports this function as the theming entry point.
 *
 * The native window is part of the contract, not decoration: the webview derives
 * `prefers-color-scheme` from the window's appearance, so the window must FOLLOW
 * the OS while the preference is `system` (`setTheme(null)`) and is pinned only
 * to a mode the user picked explicitly. A pinned window makes the media query
 * report the pinned mode instead of the OS one and stops the OS change event
 * arriving, which is why `system` resolves against the query only after the
 * release lands.
