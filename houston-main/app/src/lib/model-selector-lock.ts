/**

 * Split out from the components (like the sibling `model-picker.ts` helpers) so
 * the Teams behavior is unit-testable without a React renderer and the
 * containers stay under the file-size budget.
 *
 * Teams E8 (contract Change 3) reversed E7's "hidden for members" rule. In a
 * multiplayer Teams org the composer's model + effort pickers are shown for
 * EVERYONE (plain members included), their option list is clamped to the agent's
 * allowed-models ceiling, and they read+write the ACTING user's PERSONAL
 * per-agent choice as the default for new missions. An open mission's in-ceiling
 * activity pin wins. Single-player / self-host is unchanged: shared config, no
 * ceiling, every model. These helpers mirror the gateway's resolution so the
 * picker shows the pin that the next turn will run.
