/**
 * Supabase auth-js coordinates token refresh across browser contexts (tabs,
 * webviews, Houston's multi-window shell) with the Web Locks API. When one
 * context's lock acquire times out, auth-js recovers by *stealing* the lock
 * (`navigator.locks.request(name, { steal: true }, …)`). Per the Web Locks
 * spec the displaced holder's request promise then rejects. Depending on the
 * browser build and the bundled auth-js version that surfaces as either:
 *
 *   - a raw DOMException — "Lock was stolen by another request" or
 *     "Lock broken by another request with the 'steal' option", or
 *   - auth-js's typed `NavigatorLockAcquireTimeoutError`, which carries
 *     `isAcquireTimeout === true` (the `ProcessLock` variant sets it too).
 *
 * None of these are real failures: the steal *is* the recovery and the auto
 * refresh simply retries on its next tick. Supabase fires that refresh from an
 * internal timer we can't attach a `.catch` to, so when it rejects it reaches
 * our global `onunhandledrejection` handler. Without this guard it became a
 * scary "we have a problem" toast for non-technical users plus unactionable
 * Sentry noise (HOU-435 / HOUSTON-APP-8Y, dup APP-6Q).
 *
 * Treat it as background lock contention: swallow it, don't surface it. This is
 * NOT a banned silent-failure — the rejection comes from a background timer, is
 * not a user-initiated action, and is recovered automatically. User-initiated
 * auth calls (sign-in, code exchange) are awaited with their own try/catch in
 * `auth.ts`, so those rejections are *handled* and never reach this predicate.

/**
 * WebKit's abort-time fetch teardown noise (PRODUCT-1436, HOUSTON-APP-4ZZ /
 * 4Z3). Aborting a `fetch` whose response body is locked to an active reader
 * makes WKWebView reject an INTERNAL promise no user code can reach, with the
 * WebKit-only `AbortError` phrasing "Fetch is aborted". Every promise our own
 * stream plumbing exposes is already handled — `streamEventsResumable` and
 * `streamGlobalEvents` catch the aborted read, and `readEventStream` defuses
 * the duplicate `reader.closed` rejection (this quirk's "Load failed" twin) —
 * so this exact message on an UNHANDLED rejection can only be the platform's
 * internal promise, fired by our own deliberate teardown (an observer stream's
 * idle-sync stop, a token-rotation disconnect). Nothing broke; swallow it.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow — WebKit's exact abort phrasing, not any `AbortError`:
 * a floating aborted promise in our code is a real bug and must keep reaching
 * the report path.
