// The IN-APP fan-out of analytics events.
//
// `analytics.track` reports to PostHog; this is how the app itself hears the
// same beat. The Academy's usage economy is the first listener: "the user did
// something worth points" is already expressed once, as an analytics event, and
// re-deriving it from a dozen call sites would guarantee the two drift apart.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free — the event names come from the vocabulary, not
// from analytics.ts, which drags in PostHog and the engine adapter and so
// cannot be loaded outside a browser — and deliberately SYNCHRONOUS, so a
// listener sees the event in the same tick the user acted.
