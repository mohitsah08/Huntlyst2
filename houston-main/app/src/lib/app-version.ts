/**
 * Build identity for gateway requests: the desktop app identifies itself as
 * `<semver>+<channel>` via `X-Houston-App-Version` on every gateway call (the
 * shared adapter transport, `packages/engine-adapter/src/cp/fetch.ts`, and
 * its app-side peer `gateway-fetch.ts` both attach it). The gateway no longer
 * acts on it — the server-side min-app-version 426 gate was retired
 * (PRODUCT-1144) — but the header stays: it gives gateway logs a build
 * identity, and the CORS allow-set on every target already admits it, so
 * keeping it costs nothing while dropping it would need another coordinated
 * header/CORS dance (HOU-825) to ever bring back.
 *
 * The adapter must not import desktop code (it is bundled into the web app
 * too), so the value rides a window global — the `__HOUSTON_SESSION_REFRESH__`
 * idiom. `installAppVersionBridge` (called from `engine.ts` at module load,
 * before any client is built) installs it — gated on `osIsTauri()`, because
 * the web bundle loads `engine.ts` too and a browser tab must never identify
 * as an app build: web requests carry no header (which would force CORS
 * preflights on every target).
