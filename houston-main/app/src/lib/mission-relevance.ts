/**
 * Pure, DOM-free model of the ONE question every relevance-scoped surface asks:
 * does this mission concern ME? (HOU-945.) No React, no store, no Supabase — so
 * the rule is unit-tested once and shared verbatim by the completion
 * notification, the unread badges, and the mention notifier, which must never
 * drift apart.
 *
 * Two load-bearing fail-OPEN clauses. Neither may be dropped:
 *
 * 1. **No signed-in user (`selfId === null`) means everything is relevant.**
 *    Desktop and single player have no attribution at all; the whole feature has
 *    to be a no-op there, so behaviour stays byte-identical to today.
 * 2. **An unknown mission (`undefined`) is relevant.** Callers resolve a mission
 *    from a cache that can legitimately be a beat behind the event that woke
 *    them. Guessing "not mine" on a cache miss would swallow a real ping — the
 *    one failure mode a notification can never have — so a miss notifies.
 *
 * The "is it mine" half deliberately delegates to {@link missionMatchesMe}
 * rather than re-deriving the rule, which is what carries its own third
 * fail-open clause into this module: a mission with NO attribution whatsoever
 * counts as mine. Legacy and pre-Teams missions carry no
 * `created_by`/`contributors`, and treating them as somebody else's would go
 * silent on a long-tenured user's entire history on day one of this change.
