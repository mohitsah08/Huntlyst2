 *   can't pay for. The invite STAYS: an upgrade makes it acceptable again.
 * - `already_member` (409) — the caller is in that team already (a second
 *   window, or the auto-join that runs on a brand-new account's first contact).
 *   Not a failure: the list refresh drops the row and the team is already there.
 * - `invite_not_found` (404) — revoked, already used, or addressed to another
