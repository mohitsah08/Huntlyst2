/**
 * The DOM side of theming: the one place a theme is painted, and the boot mirror
 * that paints it on the FIRST frame.
 *
 * The stored preference (`theme`, `theme.light`, `theme.dark`, see `./theme`) is
 * the source of truth, but it reads through the SDK's appearance module via the
 * engine adapter, which only answers after the engine handshake. The boot splash
 * renders DURING that handshake and is themed (`bg-background`), so without a
 * device-local mirror a dark-mode user stares at the light surface for the whole
 * handshake (seconds on a cold start) and then snaps to dark.
 *
 * So every apply mirrors the RESOLVED theme to localStorage as JSON (mode,
 * palette, and the two hexes the first frame needs), the pre-paint script in
 * both index.html files paints from it, and `applyBootTheme()` re-applies it
 * synchronously before React mounts. Same contract as the locale flash-cache in
 * `./i18n`: a cache to avoid a flash, never the source of truth; the engine
 * value lands moments later and wins.
 *
 * DOM + localStorage only (no Tauri, no engine imports), so it is safe to
 * evaluate before the app module graph boots and stays unit-testable.
