/**
 * An agent-scoped READ answered "this agent does not exist" (HOUSTON-APP-544).
 *
 * Agent-scoped routes resolve the agent id before anything else: the hosted
 * gateway looks it up in its registry, and the host's own authz does the same
 * (`packages/host/src/routes/agent-authz.ts`) — both answer
 * `404 { error: "agent not found" }` when the id no longer resolves. For a
 * GET the client sends routinely (the skills-manifest queries), that answer
 * has exactly one meaning: the LOCAL ROSTER IS STALE. The agent was deleted
 * or unshared on another device, or a space switch's cache reset
 * (`lib/space-cache.ts`) refired queries built from the previous space's
 * roster under the new `x-houston-org` before `loadAgents` re-resolved.
 *
 * That is an expected, explainable lifecycle state, NOT a Houston bug: the
 * honest surface is the roster without the agent, so the read is silenced
 * (no red bug toast, no Sentry report — `call()` still logs it) and the
 * roster is silently reloaded so the ghost disappears on its own.
 *
 * Like `isMissingSkillError`, the classifier keys on the structural
 * `.status`: the TS host emits bare-string error bodies with no typed
 * `kind`, and an agent-scoped read has exactly one 404 path — the agent is
 * gone (a missing data file answers 200 with empty content, and a missing
 * skill goes through `isMissingSkillError` on its own route) — so the status
 * is unambiguous in context. Applied ONLY to passive reads — the manifest
 * queries and the `passiveAgentRead` wrappers in `lib/tauri.ts`
 * (HOUSTON-APP-4W3 family); writes keep the default loud surfacing.
