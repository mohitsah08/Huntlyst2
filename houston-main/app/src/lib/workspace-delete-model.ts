 * - `subscription_active` (409) — the team still carries a live subscription.
 *   The owner cancels it from Billing first, so a delete can never leave a
 *   paying subscription behind with nothing under it.
 * - `personal_space` (403) — a personal space is never deletable on its own
 *   (it goes with the account). The UI never offers it; a stale switcher can.
 * - `unknown` — anything else, which keeps the standard red bug toast.

 * server-first flow, while a false `true` is caught by the store's rollback.
 *
 * Mirrors the gateway's two 409s over fresh reads of the ACTIVE space (the
 * one being deleted) — NOT the `GET /v1/orgs` summaries, which carry no
 * billing detail:
 * - `has_members` rejects when any OTHER member row exists. `GET /v1/org`'s
 *   roster is the very same member listing the delete handler counts, and the
 *   caller (the owner) is always one row → require `members.length <= 1`. An
 *   absent roster is unverifiable → never optimistic.
 * - `subscription_active` rejects when a Stripe subscription object exists in
 *   a non-terminal state. `GET /v1/org/billing` degrades to `null` exactly
 *   when the billing surface is OFF (unconfigured / predates the route) — no
 *   Stripe object can exist there, so `null` is SAFE. On a real summary,
 *   `interval` is set exactly when a Stripe object exists, and the effective
 *   status can hide one (a solo team with a trialing/unpaid Stripe object
 *   reads `free`), so require no `interval` AND a status that is not
 *   `active`/`past_due`. `enterprise` bills off-platform — unverifiable.
