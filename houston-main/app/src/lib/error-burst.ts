/**
 * Burst collapsing for the error-surfacing layer.
 *
 * One root cause fails N concurrent calls — a dozen queries all hitting the
 * same rejected bearer during a cloud deploy (HOU-687), every live query at
 * once when the device drops offline (HOU-1085) — and each of them reaches the
 * surfacing layer independently. Only the FIRST of such a burst is a distinct
 * event: the rest are the same problem, and re-toasting or re-counting them
 * misrepresents one outage as a dozen.
 *
 * Callers key on the DISPLAYED body rather than the raw diagnostic, so a burst
 * of technically distinct failures that all render the same generic copy also
 * collapses into one — which is exactly how a non-technical user experiences
 * it.
 *
 * Split out of `error-toast.ts` so the surviving decision stays unit-testable
 * once the error path stopped rendering toasts (HOU-1245): the module it came
 * from cannot be imported by `app/tests` (it pulls the engine adapter's barrel
 * and
 * the Zustand store), this one is dependency-free.
