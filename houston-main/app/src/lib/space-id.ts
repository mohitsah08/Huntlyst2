 * C8 (`cloud/docs/contracts/C8-spaces-billing.md`, §Workspaces bridge) bridges
 * team spaces into the existing switcher: `GET /v1/workspaces` returns the
 * caller's personal workspace (opaque id, never `org:`-prefixed) plus one row
 * per team, each with id `"org:" + slug` where slug is exactly 16 lowercase hex
 * chars. Selecting a team workspace pins `x-houston-org: <slug>` (and `?org=` on
 * the two SSE routes); selecting personal sends no header.
 *
 * These pure, DOM-free helpers are the single source of truth for that id
 * grammar, so the switch wiring keys off the id alone. The list self-gates: a
 * host that returns no team rows never produces a team id, so behaviour stays
 * byte-identical to a single-workspace deployment (no capability flag needed).
