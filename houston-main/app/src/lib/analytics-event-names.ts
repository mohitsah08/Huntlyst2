/**
 * EVERY EVENT NAME `analytics.track` accepts — the closed list the whole

 *
 * Over the 200-line file ceiling on purpose: the file is ONE union type, and a

  // Onboarding funnel (acquisition→activation) — one event per step the user
  // actually clears, so a single PostHog funnel can show where first-run drops
  // off (broken down by `app_os` for Mac vs Windows). Action-first: where a
  // real action exists (AI connected, message/email sent) we fire on the
  // action, not the Continue click. Each fires exactly ONCE (ref/flag-guarded

  // Houston Academy: the learning surface was opened (`source` names where

  | "integration_connect_unavailable"
  // The web build's browser refused to open the OAuth tab (popup blocker) and
