/**
 * Recovery policy for the cross-agent conversation sweep (HOU-981).
 *
 * The hosted sweep fans out one read per agent. Any single agent can fail on
 * its own — a pod that never woke, a gateway blip — while the rest answer. The
 * adapter now keeps the agents that answered and reports the ones that didn't
 * (`AllConversationsResult.failedAgents`) instead of rejecting the whole
 * board. That leaves the query layer four obligations, all handled here:
 *
 *  1. **Don't lose the failed agents' missions.** A partial sweep must not
 *     overwrite the cache with a hole: the last-known rows for an agent that
 *     did not answer are still the best truth we have, so they are carried
 *     forward ({@link mergePartialSweep}).
 *  2. **Don't freeze the gap.** The aggregate is never refetched on focus or on
 *     a timer (a background sweep would keep every pod awake), so nothing else
 *     would revisit a partial answer inside its freshness window. A partial
 *     sweep therefore schedules its own bounded re-sweep
 *     ({@link planPartialSweep}), counted per roster
 *     ({@link stepSweepRecovery}) so a space switch starts clean.
 *  3. **Don't multiply the surface.** A whole-fleet failure is retried inside
 *     the queryFn, and every attempt but the last runs silent
 *     ({@link planSweepAttempt}) — the engine wrapper toasts and captures on
 *     each rejection, so retrying at the query layer reported one outage four
 *     times.
 *  4. **Don't call a non-answer an answer.** The board's "you have no missions"
 *     verdict waits for a settled, non-placeholder success
 *     (`sweepIsAuthoritative`, lib/sweep-authoritative.ts).
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it unit-tests under node:test; the wiring lives
 * in hooks/queries/use-conversations.ts, and HOW an incomplete sweep is told
 * to the user (waking pod vs offline vs real failure) is the sibling policy in
 * lib/partial-sweep-surface.ts.

 * event-stream reconnect, or an event naming that agent.
 *
