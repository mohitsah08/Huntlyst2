/**
 * The single message an interaction sequence sends when its LAST step
 * completes (see `useAgentChatPanel`'s `composerOverride`). Composed ONCE, never
 * per-connect: a `request_connection` step that started a turn as it landed
 * would tear the interaction card down before the remaining steps could be
 * walked, so the whole sequence resumes the agent with exactly this one send.
 *
 * The body is `"<question>: <answer>"` per answered question, then
 * `"Signed in to Houston."` if a sign-in step completed (or "Skipped signing
 * in." if the user skipped it), then `"Connected <app>."` per connection that
 * landed and `"Skipped connecting <app>."` per connect step the user skipped —
 * a skip is a fact the agent MUST hear, or it re-requests the same app
 * forever. A sequence with questions sends that body visibly (the user typed
 * those answers). A connect-ONLY / signin+connect sequence has no user-typed
 * text, so it wraps the body in the auto-continue marker: the agent still
 * receives the instruction, but the transcript hides the bubble the user never
 * actually typed.
 *
 * A SIGNIN-ONLY sequence that actually signed in (no questions, no connect
 * steps walked or skipped) has nothing factual to relay, so
 * it resumes the agent with the dedicated hidden `signedInFollowup` ("I've signed
 * in. Please continue.") instead of the bare status line.
 *
 * A saved custom-integration key adds `credentialedLine(name)` ("Added the X
 * key."), a declined one `skippedCredentialLine(name)` ("Skipped adding the X
 * key.") — a skip the agent MUST hear, or it waits on a key that never comes. A
 * credential-ONLY sequence that saved every key resumes the agent hidden with
 * `credentialedFollowup`, like a connect-only one; a skip in the mix falls to the
 * visible/hidden body path so the "Skipped ..." fact survives.
 *
 * A hands-on errand adds `handsOnLine(screen)` ("Opened X and finished there.")
 * or `handsOnSkippedLine(screen)` — the person's own word for it, since nothing
 * can observe the screen they were sent to. A sequence carrying one never takes
 * the signin-only / credential-only shortcut: that fact must reach the agent.
 *
 * Every non-question step ALSO offers a free-text decline row: declining a
 * connect / sign-in / credential step WITH typed text records a
 * decline-with-instruction, contributing `connectRedirectLine(name, text)` /
 * `signinRedirectLine(text)` / `credentialRedirectLine(name, text)` — the user's
 * verbatim "do this instead", which the agent reads and reacts to. Because it
 * carries user text, its sequence resumes VISIBLY.
 *
 * The line factories (`connectedLine` / `skippedConnectLine` / `connectRedirectLine`
 * / `signedInLine` / `skippedSigninLine` / `signinRedirectLine` / `signedInFollowup`
 * / `credentialedLine` / `skippedCredentialLine` / `credentialRedirectLine`) are
 * injected so this stays i18n-agnostic and unit-testable — the caller passes the
 * `t(...)` results.
