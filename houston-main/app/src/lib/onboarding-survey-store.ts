// engine holds, its uid-scoped localStorage mirror, and the one-time lift of
// the pre-survey segment preference. Split from `hooks/use-onboarding-survey`
// so the hook stays React-only — this module is the persistence layer.
//
// Every device-touching call goes through {@link SurveyStorePorts}, injected by
// the caller (`./onboarding-survey-ports.ts` wires the live ones), so the
// durability rules below are driven directly by `app/tests` with no engine, no
// browser storage and no network.
