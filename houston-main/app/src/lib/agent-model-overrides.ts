 *
 * A send WITHOUT provider/model pins does not run on the agent's configured
 * model: the runtime resolves an unpinned turn from its OWN `settings.json`
 * (`activeProvider` + `models[provider]`), never from the agent config the
 * model picker writes (`.houston/config/config.json`) — so it lands on the
 * provider default (Sonnet). The config only reaches a turn as the pins each
 * send forwards, which is exactly what the chat panel's `effectiveProvider` /
 * `effectiveModel` do; this is the same resolution for kickoffs created
 * outside a panel — INCLUDING the panel's auth gate, so a kickoff never opens
 * on a provider the user has not connected (PRODUCT-1236).

 * creation chat open on a provider they never connected.

 * offer, so the stored provider stands and its sign-in error is the surface.
