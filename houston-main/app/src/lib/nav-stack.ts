/**
 * The app's navigation stack: an explicit push-stack of screen-level locations
 * (tab → employee board → chat panel), modeled in the ui store and mirrored into
 * the browser history by `lib/nav-history.ts` so back/forward (and Android's
 * hardware back) walk the app instead of leaving it.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO router: an entry is a snapshot of the store fields
 * that say where the user is, not a URL. The one-shot handoff fields
 * (`activityPanelId`, `pendingRoutineChat`, …) are excluded on purpose — they
 * are messages between surfaces, not places, and replaying one on back would
 * re-fire its side effect.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the stack semantics are unit-testable; the store
 * (`stores/ui.ts`) is the only caller of `navigated`, and the history sync
 * layer is the only code in the app allowed to touch `history`.

 *   history retreats with the UI; anywhere else it replaces, because a close
 *   is not a new place and pushing it would make browser-back "reopen" what

 *   destination as its only entry — native tab semantics: changing tabs
 *   abandons the old tab's trail rather than stacking on top of it. The
 *   history mirror echoes a rebuild as `replaceState`, and the browser's now
