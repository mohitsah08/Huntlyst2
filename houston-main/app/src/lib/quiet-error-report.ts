/**
 * The Sentry half of a quiet-class failure (PRODUCT-1640): the user got the
 * deduped informational toast (or nothing, for a `{ toast: false }` path), we
 * get ONE warning-level event per burst in the class's single fingerprinted
 * issue, carrying the command, agent, status and raw gateway body.
 *
 * Burst-collapsed with the toast layer's window (`quietBurstKey`): a dozen
 * concurrent reads of one waking agent are one occurrence of one problem, and
 * counting them twelve times would only inflate the issue's numbers against a
 * Sentry quota. For the waking class distinct commands and distinct agents
 * still count separately, so the issue's event list reads as a per-agent
 * timeline; the offline class is one event per drop, whatever fell with it.
 *
 * For the waking class the answer also feeds the per-agent stuck-wake tracker;
 * an agent answering nothing but waking past the threshold escalates once, as
 * an error-level `waking_stuck` event with the first and last raw bodies.
