 *    fetch, whose `isLoading` re-arms App.tsx's auth-gate splash (a full-screen
 *    unmount), the very blank the in-place switch (HOU-907) exists to remove.
 *  - `onboarding-pending` / `onboarding-completed` — the durable first-run
 *    flags. They gate the onboarding-vs-shell route in App.tsx; flashing them to
 *    loading on a switch flaps that gate (and, on a switch INTO an empty team
 *    space, would momentarily route a completed user back toward onboarding
 *    before the flag refetches). They are the same across every space, so there
 *    is nothing tenant-specific to reset.
 *

/**
 * Drop the query cache on a real active-space change (C8 §Active space), EXCEPT
 * the user-scoped, space-invariant keys above.
 *
 * Tenant query keys are NOT org-scoped: the active space is only an
 * `x-houston-org` request header, so team A and team B collide on the same key.
 * `removeQueries` (not `invalidateQueries`) is required — `invalidateQueries`
 * only marks queries stale and refetches ACTIVE observers, leaving every
 * INACTIVE query's data in cache for `gcTime`. A not-currently-mounted view
 * (e.g. an agent board loaded under the prior space) would then serve that prior
 * space's data via stale-while-revalidate on navigation before the refetch
 * resolves — a cross-tenant data flash. The predicate discards inactive-query
 * data too, so every tenant query refetches clean under the new space while the
 * space-invariant user keys are left intact (HOU-907).
 *
 * In-flight connect hand-offs are stopped alongside the wipe. A connect poll
 * deliberately outlives the surface that started it, but it must NOT outlive
 * the IDENTITY it started under: its next tick would carry the new
 * `x-houston-org` and read a connection id that belongs to the previous space —
 * a red failure toast for an app the new space never touched, or a success
 * toast plus an invalidation landing in the cache we are wiping right here.
 *
 * A no-op when the space did not change (same-space reselect, or every switch on
 * a personal-only host where every id maps to null).
