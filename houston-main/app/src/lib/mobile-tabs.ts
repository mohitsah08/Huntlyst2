/**
 * The phone nav bar's model: which of its two items the current location
 * lights up.
 *
 * The bar is a Linear-style floating pill with two entries, AI Employees and
 * More, plus a separate round compose button. AI Employees is a TREE: it roots
 * on the employee list and holds every employee drill-in below it. More is a
 * MENU over the shell (the account row, the long tail of destinations), so it
 * lights for every location the tree does not own rather than
 * naming a screen of its own.
 *
 * Pure and store-free so the rule is unit-tested (`app/tests/mobile-tabs.
 * test.ts`); the imperative side, which reads the stores and dispatches a
 * tap, is `lib/open-mobile-tab.ts` — the same split as `agent-nav.ts` /
 * `open-agent.ts`.
