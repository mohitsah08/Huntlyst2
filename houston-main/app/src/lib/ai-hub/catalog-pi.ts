/**
 * Map the pi-ai provider catalog (`@houston/protocol` `ProviderCatalog`, the
 * host's `GET /v1/catalog` = the RUNNABLE set) into the internal merge candidates
 * the hub folds into unique models. This is the AUTHORITATIVE base source: every
 * model in the hub exists because pi-ai can run it, with pi's own pricing,
 * context window, reasoning, and vision. The models.dev snapshot only enriches
 * these afterwards (see `foldEnrichment`); it never adds a model.
 *
 * Provider ids are put through the SAME renames the frontend uses when hydrating
 * `PROVIDERS` (`DROP_PI_PROVIDERS` first, then `PROVIDER_ID_RENAME`), so an
 * offer's `providerId` + preserved `modelId` reproduce the picker's
 * `${providerId}::${modelId}` key exactly. Nothing is re-hardcoded here.

 * (`VISIBLE_MODELS` in `provider-overrides.ts`), the same table `buildProvider`
 * filters the hydrated `PROVIDERS` with. A provider without a `VISIBLE_MODELS`
 * entry carries its full pi model list. Hidden ids stay runnable on the wire;
