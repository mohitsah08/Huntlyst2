/**
 * Pure, DOM/i18n-free logic for PER-USER AI accounts (HOU-976).
 *
 * In a TEAM space every turn runs on the AI account of the person who sent it —
 * there is no shared team AI account to resolve against, and no scope to
 * address on the wire. What is left for the client is honesty: reading WHICH
 * account the server says answered, so a surface can label it. The decisions
 * are gathered here so each is unit-tested without a React renderer
 * (`app/tests/credential-scope.test.ts`).
 *
 * ABSENCE IS THE OLD WORLD. Every per-scope wire field is optional and omitted
 * whenever the turn/request carried no acting identity — desktop, self-host, a
 * personal space, routines. Every helper below therefore treats "no scope
 * information" as "one account, nothing to disambiguate", which is exactly the
 * rendering that shipped before this feature.
