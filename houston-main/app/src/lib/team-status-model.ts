 * under bare Node.
 *
 * Contract (C8 §Client UX): countdown/billing affordances are owner/admin-only;
 * members NEVER see billing data — on an expired team they see the degrade
 * banner with "ask your owner" copy, driven by `OrgSummary.degraded` (which
 * carries no billing detail). Nothing renders off a Spaces host or off a team
 * space (single-player / personal). Expiry is a DERIVED read with no push, so
 * the caller re-reads billing/orgs on entering a team space.
