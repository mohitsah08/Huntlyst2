import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

/**
 * Low-noise Sentry captures for the error-surfacing layer's quiet classes
 * (PRODUCT-1640). Split from `sentry.ts` because these are a different
 * contract from `captureException` there: that one confirms delivery (it
 * flushes and waits for the 2xx, the price of the old "report sent" toast),
 * this one is fire-and-forget, and — the point — it FIXES the grouping. A
 * fingerprint of one constant per class makes the whole class ONE issue with
 * a count, so a deploy roll that fails hundreds of reads across the fleet
 * adds events to that issue and never files a new one. The raw gateway body
 * rides as `extra`, where Sentry's event search can still find it.
 *
 * The fingerprint only holds if no server-side fingerprinting rule matches
 * first: a matched rule REPLACES the client fingerprint (the SDK's value
 * survives only as `_fingerprint_info.client_fingerprint`). The project's
 * `value:"Load failed*"` / `value:"Failed to fetch*"` rules did exactly that
 * to every offline capture, re-flipping the old transport-drop issues to
 * regressed. The project now pins `tags.quiet_class:<class> -> <class>` ABOVE
 * those rules, so `quiet_class` must stay a tag on every quiet capture and
 * its value must equal the fingerprint constant.
 *
 * No-op until `initSentry` ran (dev builds without the send-in-dev opt-in,
 * forks with no DSN), same as every other capture.
