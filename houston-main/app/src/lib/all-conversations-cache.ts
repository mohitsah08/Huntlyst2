/**
 * Cache-variant fallback for the all-conversations aggregate.
 *
 * The aggregate's query key embeds EVERY agent's folderPath from the async,
 * non-persisted agents roster (`["all-conversations", ...agentPaths]`), so the
 * IndexedDB-restored entry (query-persist.ts) only re-attaches when the roster
 * resolves byte-identical — same paths, same order. Any drift (roster still
 * loading, an agent added/removed/reordered since the persist) strands the
 * restored lists under a stale key, and everything derived from the aggregate
 * (sidebar needs-you badges, Mission Control, the command palette) blanks
 * until the live fan-out returns — which a cold pod holds for its whole wake.
 *
 * This helper serves the NEWEST successfully-fetched variant of the key as
 * PLACEHOLDER data: painted immediately, marked `isPlaceholderData`, never
 * persisted, and always replaced by the real fetch when it lands.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (QueryClient only) so `node --test` exercises it.

 * session outlives the pod wake plus the persister's write throttle — so on a
 * cold open it is often absent for the very agent being looked at. The
 * aggregate, by contrast, is swept every session for every agent (the sidebar
 * always mounts it): whenever the sidebar can paint its badges, this can
 * paint the same missions as cards instead of empty columns held for the
 * whole pod wake.
 *
 * Empty is not evidence: rows can be missing because the agent truly has no
 * missions OR because a cached sweep skipped it, so no-rows returns
 * `undefined` — preserving the caller's "still loading" state — never `[]`.
