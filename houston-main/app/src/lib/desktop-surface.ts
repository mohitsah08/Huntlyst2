/**
 * Stamp `data-desktop` on the document root when running inside the Tauri
 * shell (the caller passes `osIsTauri()` — not imported here so this stays
 * loadable outside a webview, e.g. under node:test). futuristic.css keys its
 * opaque floating-surface fallback on this attribute (section 3b): WebView2
 * does not reliably composite backdrop-filter, so the glass popover fill —
 * solid-looking only through its blur — painted see-through on desktop.
 * (Dialogs are solid in both themes now, no fallback needed.) A plain
 * browser (the web build, or the dev vite URL opened directly) never gets
 * the attribute and keeps the frosted glass.
