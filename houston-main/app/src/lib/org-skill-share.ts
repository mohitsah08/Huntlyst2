// Org skill by default (HOU-1192): a skill an agent creates in a
// create-with-AI chat is promoted into the workspace/org skill store the
// moment the client detects it, and enabled ONLY for the agent that built it
// (one explicit manifest write, per ADR 0003). The other agents are NOT
// installed to — the skill sits in the workspace store where the user can
// enable it per agent from the Skills surfaces. Dependency-injected and
// framework-free so the whole flow is node-testable
// (app/tests/org-skill-share.test.ts); the hook wrapper
// (components/agent/use-org-skill-default.ts) binds it to the engine adapter.

/**
 * True when the workspace store DECLINED the promotion for an expected,
 * explainable reason — feature absence or policy, not a Houston bug:
 *
 * - 409: the slug already exists in the store (the agent picked a name a
 *   workspace skill already uses; the local copy stays and shadows it).
 * - 403: this user may not write org skills here (Teams: member role — the
 *   gateway enforces admin-only org-skill writes).
 * - 404: the deployment predates the shared-skills routes entirely (the
 *   HOU-1105 rule: a missing route is feature absence, not a bug). The share
 *   is attempted even while `/v1/capabilities` is still loading — a one-shot
 *   claim must not be dropped on a startup race — so the wire's own answer
 *   has to close that path quietly.
 * - 503 "shared skills not configured": the deployment runs no store.
 *
 * On any of these the new skill simply stays agent-local — exactly the
 * pre-HOU-1192 behavior. Structural on `.status` + body, never on message
 * strings (the sibling classifiers' rule).
