/**
 * The ONE way app code talks to the Houston cloud gateway.
 *
 * Three call sites used to hand-roll this (account deletion, the cloud-migration
 * wizard, the onboarding-survey store), each with a slightly different subset of
 * the rules. The canonical implementation is the engine adapter's
 * `gatewayAuthFetch` (`packages/engine-adapter/src/cp/fetch.ts`), which app
 * code cannot import — `@houston/engine-adapter` does not export it and the
 * package boundary (`pnpm check:boundaries`) is the point. So this is its
 * app-side peer, and it keeps parity on all four rules:
 *
 *  1. LIVE BEARER — read per attempt, never a pinned copy, so a silent token
 *     refresh is picked up without rebuilding anything.
 *  2. 401 → one refresh, one replay. A 401 that survives the refresh is handed
 *     back as-is: a real sign-out must surface, not spin. A refresh beaten
 *     TRANSIENTLY by the network throws a transport-shaped `TypeError` instead
 *     (HOU-1106), so a settling reconnect reads as connectivity, not auth.
 *     Concurrent callers share ONE refresh, because refresh tokens rotate on
 *     use and racing mints can invalidate each other (`./gateway-refresh.ts`,
 *     this repo's mirror of the canonical `session-refresh.ts`).
 *  3. ACTIVE SPACE — `x-houston-org: <slug>` whenever a team space is pinned
 *     (C8), read live per attempt off the same global the engine adapter uses.
 *     Absent ⇒ the gateway resolves the caller's personal space, which is what
 *     404'd every org-scoped `/agents/:slug/migration/*` call from a team.
 *     A USER-scoped route opts out per request ({@link GatewayRequestInit}).
 *  4. BUILD IDENTITY — `X-Houston-App-Version: <semver>+<channel>` on every
 *     request, riding the window global `app/src/lib/app-version.ts` installs
 *     (desktop only: a browser tab must never send the header, which would
 *     force a CORS preflight every target would have to allow). Nothing
 *     server-side acts on it since the version floor was retired
 *     (PRODUCT-1144); it remains for log/debug attribution.
 *
 * Dependency-injected end to end so `app/tests` drives it with no window and no
 * network.

   *
   * Set it FALSE for a route that is USER-scoped, because the header does not
   * merely go unread there — it changes the answer. The gateway resolves the
   * pin BEFORE the handler (`ResolveOrg`) and derives the write gate's billing
   * from whatever it resolved (`gateWrites`), so a plain member of an expired
   * team would get a silent 403 on their own `/v1/me/*` write, and a stale slug
   * a 403 `not_member` on their own read. Same reasoning as the web shim's
   * `/feedback` call: personal data must not be hostage to a team's state.
