/**
 * One cache for workspace-file bytes, shared by the two surfaces that can
 * download the SAME file: the Files grid thumbnails (`useFilePreviewLoader`)
 * and the in-app preview dialog (`FilePreviewDialog`). Before this, opening a
 * file whose thumbnail had just been fetched downloaded the exact same bytes a
 * second time (HOU-970).
 *
 * Blobs live in the query cache briefly (five minutes), so two rules keep it
 * from turning into a memory hazard:
 *
 * 1. **Keyed per file + mtime, cached only when there IS an mtime.** Bytes are
 *    immutable for a given `dateModified`, so an edited file lands on a fresh
 *    key. Callers with no mtime to key on (chat-opened previews, which carry
 *    only a path) bypass the cache entirely: a placeholder key would serve
 *    stale bytes, and caching them as always-stale would pin blobs in memory
 *    for zero reuse.
 * 2. **Only files the grid could have thumbnailed.** `previewKind` bounds what
 *    a thumbnail ever fetches (small images, small text). Anything outside it,
 *    say an 80 MB deck opened for the dialog's "download to open" fallback, can
 *    never share bytes with a thumbnail, so it streams straight through. Ask
 *    `sharedBytesKey` rather than reaching for `dateModified` directly.
