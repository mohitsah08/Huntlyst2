 *  - `none` — a dismissed offer, a sequence with a blocking step, or no
 *             suggest_reusable offer → no card.
 *
 * Unlike plan-ready's resolver there is NO "stepper" branch here: the optional
 * offers can coexist with each other, while blocking steps are handled by the
 * interaction stepper instead.
 *
 * `dismissedId` is the id of the offer the user chose to skip: dismissal is
 * per-step-id, so a LATER, different suggestion (different id) re-shows the card.
 * Pure so the branch is unit-tested without the panel's event plumbing.
