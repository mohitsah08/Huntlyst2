/**
 * The optimistic shape of a routine edit (PRODUCT-1706): what the routines
 * list shows the instant a save is sent, before the host answers.
 *
 * A routine write on the hosted profile can take seconds (the agent's pod may
 * have to wake first), and the list used to keep painting the OLD schedule
 * for that whole window — a saved 7:00 still read 11:30, so the save looked
 * ignored. This mirrors the host's own `applyRoutineUpdate` closely enough
 * for the interim paint: defined keys replace, `null` clears a pin or the
 * trigger, and setting one wake mechanism drops the other. The host's applied
 * routine replaces the guess as soon as it lands.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free so it is unit-tested without a query client
 * (`app/tests/routine-optimistic.test.ts`).
