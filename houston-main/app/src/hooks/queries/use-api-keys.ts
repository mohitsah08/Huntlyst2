 * every hook self-gates on `capabilities.apiKeys`, so off-cloud (desktop,
 * self-host) the query never fires and the section never renders.
 *
 * The wire calls route through `tauriApiKeys.*` → the engine adapter's `call()`
 * wrapper, which surfaces any failure once as a red bug toast + Sentry report
 * (the required no-silent-failures path). So these hooks carry no `onError` — a
 * second toast would double up (same as `use-billing.ts`). The one exception is
 * the mint's `key_limit`, which `tauriApiKeys.create` silences so the section
 * can render it inline; the mutation error is read by the caller for that.
