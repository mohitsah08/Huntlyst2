 * flag is what makes "Remove picture" meaningful).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT multiplayer-gated, unlike `useOrgPeople` — naming
 * yourself is not a team feature; every signed-in user gets it. It only needs a
 * configured identity backend and a live session. Off-gateway, or on a gateway
 * predating the route (which 404s), the read degrades to `null` and the caller
 * hides the profile section rather than offering an editor that cannot save.
 * A failure never toasts and is never captured (see `tauriProfile.get`): it is
 * indistinguishable from "this host has no such feature" by design.
 *
 * Cached generously — a profile changes when the user changes it, and that path
 * writes the fresh value straight into this cache ({@link useSetMyProfile}).

 * Save the user's own name and/or photo. Per key: a string sets, `null` clears

 * editor that only changed the name must send only `displayName`.
 *
 * `onSuccess` seeds the returned profile into this hook's cache (the host's
 * truth, not an optimistic guess) and then invalidates every OTHER cache that
 * paints a face or a name, so the change lands everywhere at once instead of
 * only in the settings form:
 * - `USER_PROFILES_KEY` by prefix — the caller's own self-face plus every
 *   teammate face stack (each is `[USER_PROFILES_KEY, ...ids]`);
 * - `ORG_PEOPLE_KEY` — the @mention roster the composer and renderer read;
 * - `queryKeys.org()` — the People roster behind the Permissions/Admin views.
 *
 * Carries no `onError`: `tauriProfile.set` routes through `call()`, which
 * already surfaces the failure as a red toast AND reports it to Sentry once
 * (the host's 400 for a too-long name or an oversized picture included).
 * Adding an `onError` here would double-toast.
