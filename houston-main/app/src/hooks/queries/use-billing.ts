/**
 * C8 billing hooks for the active team space (`GET/POST /v1/org/billing*`).
 *
 * Reading is owner/admin-only and team-space-only: `useBilling` self-gates on
 * `caps.spaces` (the whole Spaces surface feature-detect), the active workspace
 * being a team (`org:*` id), AND the caller being owner/admin (`canSeeBilling`).
 * Off any of those — single-player, a personal space, or a plain member — the
 * query never fires and nothing renders; a member reads the degrade state from
 * `OrgSummary.degraded` instead (C8 §Client UX: members NEVER see billing data).
 *
 * No push on expiry — the effective `status` is a DERIVED read. So the client
 * re-reads on TWO triggers: entering a team space (the E3 space switch drops the
 * whole query cache via `resetCacheForSpaceChange`, so this refetches clean under
 * the new space — NOT duplicated here) and returning to the window
 * (`refetchOnWindowFocus`), which catches an expiry that elapsed while away.
 *
 * The wire calls route through `tauriOrg.*` → the engine adapter's `call()`
 * wrapper, which surfaces any failure once as a red bug toast + Sentry report
 * (the required no-silent-failures path). So these hooks carry no `onError` — a
 * second toast would double up (same as `use-orgs.ts` / `use-spaces.ts`).
 */

/**
 * The active team's billing summary, or `null` when off-entitlement (the wire
 * swallows the not-entitled 404/403 and the billing-off 503 → null). Enabled
 * only for an owner/admin on a team space of a Spaces-capable host.
 *
 * There is no on-screen gate: the shell's team-status strip renders over EVERY
 * screen of a team space and holds this query hot for as long as the space is
 * open, so a second caller gating itself would only read the same cached
 * summary a moment later — a gate that buys nothing and reads as if it did.
