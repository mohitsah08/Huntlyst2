 * missions, so anything that takes a baseline from one (a lesson beat
 * waiting for a new conversation) would count every mission the user already had as brand new. `count` is
 * withheld entirely until the sweep settles rather than reported as zero.
 *
 * No fetch of its own: this is the same cache key the sidebar badges and
 * Mission Control mount, keyed by the roster's folder paths.
