/**
 * The org audit feed (Teams v2), newest first, paged by a before-cursor.
 *
 * Multiplayer-only and owner/admin-only: on a plain-member or single-player
 * host the gateway 403s (or `getOrg`'s absence means the Organization view is
 * never rendered), so the caller gates `enabled` on `capabilities.multiplayer`
 * + role. Each page is an `AuditEntry[]`; the next page starts before the last
 * entry's id, and paging stops once a short page proves the tail was reached.
 *
 * No `HoustonEvent` maps to audit writes (they're fire-and-forget server-side),
 * so there's nothing to invalidate on — a window-focus refetch keeps the feed
 * reasonably fresh without a firehose subscription. Failures surface via the
 * `tauriOrg.audit` → `call()` path (toast + Report bug), no `onError` needed.
