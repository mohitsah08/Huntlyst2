 *    so they paint instantly with their last-known connected state instead of
 *    hiding behind a skeleton while the CLIs are probed; the probe below
 *    reconciles within seconds and persists the confirmed scan
 *    (`saveCachedProviderStatuses`) for the next visit.
 *  - `loadStatuses` probes every visible card in ONE engine round-trip
 *    (`checkAllStatuses`): on the new engine that collapses to a single
 *    `listProviders()` (HOU-650) rather than a probe per gateway. A card may
 *    front several gateways (OpenCode's Zen + Go share one key), so we probe the
 *    union of gateway ids and merge per card with `mergeGatewayStatus`.
 *  - The FIRST scan is a baseline so opening the hub with a provider already
 *    connected doesn't fire a fake `provider_configured` analytics event;
 *    subsequent scans track disconnected -> connected transitions.
 *  - `patchAuthState` optimistically flips a card after a known auth outcome
 *    (completed connect / sign-out) so it doesn't wait on the multi-second
 *    CLI re-probe; `loadStatuses` reconciles against the real probe.
