 * provider as "Not connected" for the few seconds the engine spent probing the
 * provider CLIs. Keyed under `queryKeys.providerStatuses()` so it is
 * invalidated when a provider login completes (see use-agent-invalidation.ts);
 * `staleTime` keeps repeat opens instant, and the default window-focus refetch
 * picks up out-of-band auth changes.
 *
 * SPACE SAFETY (HOU-979). Provider connections are tenant data and the probe
 * routes per-agent, so this query carries the SAME two guards the AI-hub's
 * sibling hook has:
 *
 *  1. the active workspace id is part of the key, so team and personal never
 *     share a cache entry (the active space is only a request header — without
 *     this they collide and one space can serve the other's statuses); and
 *  2. the query is disabled until the CURRENT space's agent list has settled,
 *     so the probe is never routed at the previous space's agent under the new
 *     org header (which 404s and stamps every provider `unknown` — the picker
 *     then rendered no providers at all).
 *
 * The gate is the natural refetch trigger too: `enabled` flipping true once
 * agents settle makes TanStack fetch the new space's key immediately, with no
 * hand-rolled effect.
 *
 * UNREACHABLE IS AN ERROR (HOU-1153). The engine adapter's batched probe never
 * rejects: a host still booting, a cold pod, or unsettled per-agent routing all
 * resolve every provider as `unknown`. Taken at face value that is a settled
 * answer, so nothing ever retried — the picker sat on "Loading providers…"
 * indefinitely and the connect-AI composer never appeared. Here the RESULT is
 * classified (`classifyStatusScan`) and an information-free scan is thrown, so
 * the query carries a real error state and a bounded re-probe
 * (`providerStatusesRefetchInterval`) lands the definitive answer seconds later
 * with no user action. The AI-hub's sibling hook keeps consuming the raw
 * all-unknown shape on purpose — it has a last-known snapshot to protect.
