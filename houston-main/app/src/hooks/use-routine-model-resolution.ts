/**
 * The provider + model a routine will actually RUN ON (PRODUCT-1475).
 *
 * A routine is either PINNED (it carries its own provider/model, which the fire
 * path honors verbatim) or it follows the agent — and "follows the agent" was
 * all the editor ever said, which told the user nothing about which AI account
 * was about to be billed or whether it even worked. So this resolves the pair
 * either way, reusing the two derivations that already own the answer rather
 * than inventing a third:
 *
 *  - `resolveAgentModelOverrides` — the agent's configured brain, the SAME
 *    resolution every routine/skill kickoff pins its turn with; and
 *  - `resolvePersonalModelPin` — the acting user's per-agent choice in
 *    multiplayer Teams, mirroring the gateway's per-turn resolution.
 *
 * NEVER auth-switch here. `resolveAgentModelOverrides` can substitute a
 * connected provider when handed a confirmed connection set; it is deliberately
 * handed none, because the health badge beside this pair exists to SHOW that
 * the resolved provider is unusable. Substituting a working one would hide the
 * exact state this feature was built to surface.
