/**
 * The React binding that FEEDS the app's live read-cursor store (HOU-945).
 *
 * Everything stateful lives in `lib/read-cursor-live-store.ts`, which is
 * React-free so a notification callback running with no component mounted reads
 * the very same store the shell wrote. This module adds only the part that
 * genuinely needs React: the effect that mounts the "conversation viewed"
 * observer.
 */

/**
 * Cache events that mean "this conversation is being read RIGHT NOW": it was
 * just put on screen (`observerAdded`), or fresh content landed in it
 * (`updated` — a refetch after the `ConversationsChanged` invalidation, i.e. a
 * teammate's turn repainting the open chat).
 *
 * Everything else is deliberately ignored, and the exclusion is load-bearing
 * rather than an optimization: `observerOptionsUpdated` fires on EVERY RENDER of
 * every component holding the query (React Query hands the observer a fresh
 * options object each time). Marking on those made the tracker a render-driven
 * write — each one stamps a NEW `Date.now()`, so the cursor store changed on
 * every render and notified its subscribers. That was invisible while only the
 * sidebar read the store (it observes no chat history, so the cascade stopped),
 * and became an infinite update loop the moment a SECOND surface subscribed:
 * store change → board re-render → options updated → new cursor → store change.

 * Mounts the "conversation viewed" tracker. Call once, at the top of the app.
 *
 * The seam is the `["chat-history", agentPath, sessionKey]` query that EVERY
 * surface opening a chat mounts, observed raw so no surface has to remember to
 * report anything. `getObserversCount() > 0` is what makes it mean "open on
 * screen" rather than "still in cache". It re-marks on every VIEWED event (see
 * {@link VIEWED_EVENTS}), not just the first, so a conversation the user is
 * watching while it streams cannot go stale-unread under them.
