/**
 * OS notifications for @mentions (HOU-945): when a teammate types your name in
 * a mission, you hear about it even if Houston is in the background and the
 * mission is not yours.
 *
 * There is no push channel for mentions, and adding one would mean a new
 * subscription per user. Instead this rides the conversation lists the shell
 * ALREADY sweeps: a raw `QueryCache.subscribe` (no query observer, so it can
 * never trigger a fetch or wake a pod) watches the `all-conversations`
 * aggregate and the per-agent `activity` lists, and re-scans the cached rows for
 * a mention newer than the watermark this user has already been pinged about.
 *
 * The watermark ({@link markConversationMentionNotified}) is bumped BEFORE the
 * notification is sent and persists to disk, so one mention aggregate pings
 * exactly once — across re-renders, across a re-scan triggered a millisecond
 * later by a sibling list, and across app restarts.
