/**
 * Completion-notification latches, keyed by `agentPath::sessionKey`.
 *
 * A session's OS notification is latched at `SessionStatus completed` and fired
 * on the settle's `ActivityChanged` echo — the ordering where the interaction
 * the turn ended on has been folded into the conversation VM (by
 * `persistBoardStatus`) and is readable, so the body reads question / connect /
 * plain finish correctly.
 *
 * The catch: `ActivityChanged` carries only an `agentPath`, no session key (see
 * `packages/protocol/src/events.ts`). So a single agent's echo can't name WHICH
 * of its sessions settled. Firing every latch for the agent is wrong: a second
 * session that completed in the same batch — or an unrelated `.houston` write
 * that also emits `ActivityChanged` — would fire a latch whose own settle hasn't
 * folded yet, sending it the plain body and then discarding it, so its real echo
 * has nothing left to correct. The `ready` gate closes that window: a latch
 * fires on an agent echo ONLY once its own settle has folded; a premature echo
 * is skipped, leaving the latch for the session's own (later) echo. The grace
 * timer force-fires as the backstop for a completed session this client never
 * folds a VM for (no board card).
