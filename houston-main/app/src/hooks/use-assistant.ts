/**
 * Discover the user's personal assistant.
 *
 * The assistant is an ordinary agent conversation, so this address is the ONLY
 * thing the app cannot work out for itself; every call the chat then makes is
 * the existing per-agent surface. Discovery is lazy on the host (it materializes
 * the hidden agent on first ask) and idempotent, so asking once at boot is both
 * cheap and what makes the rail row honest.
 *
 * Three answers, read by `classifyAssistantDiscoveryFailure`:
 *
 *  - **No assistant here** — a deployment whose host does not implement
 *    discovery (a gateway fronts it, or it holds no agent tree), a gateway that
 *    predates the route, or one with no assistant credential bound. That is
 *    feature ABSENCE: it settles hidden and is never asked again.
 *  - **Not yet** — the gateway's answer while an engine pod provisions, wakes
 *    or is replaced. Recoverable, so it is retried with backoff (honouring a
 *    retry hint the failure advertises) and, once the budget is spent, polled
 *    on a slow beat while the screen says so and offers `retry`.
 *  - **Anything else** — a real failure, kept on the loud path (the log and
 *    Sentry get it) with one blind retry so a gateway handoff does not cost a
 *    session's assistant. The user is told the same honest thing as above and
 *    never sees the failure's shape.
 *
 * Neither of the last two takes the assistant off the screen: a deployment
 * that HAS an assistant and cannot start it must stay somewhere the user can
 * ask again, not vanish until the next app launch (PRODUCT-1795).
 *
 * `staleTime` is infinite for the SUCCESS case only: an address does not
 * change under us. A query holding no data is stale whatever that value says,
 * which is exactly what makes an unanswered discovery keep trying.
