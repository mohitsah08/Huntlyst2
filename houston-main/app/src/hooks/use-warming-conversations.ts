/**
 * Reactive slice of the optimistic warm-up rows (HOU-713) for the CROSS-AGENT
 * board: every mission queued while some agent's engine cold-starts, shaped as
 * a `running` conversation the sweep never returned.
 *
 * Agents have no board of their own any more, so this is the only place those
 * missions can appear — and the "just created an agent" flow lands straight on
 * an employee board, which is exactly when an engine is coldest. Empty (and stable)
 * when nothing is warming, so consumers merge unconditionally. The store bumps
 * `sendsVersion` on every queue — that is the re-render signal, since entries
 * mutate in place.
