 * Fetch the host's pi-ai provider catalog (`GET /v1/catalog`) once and hydrate
 * the module-level `PROVIDERS` cache with it, so the picker + connect surfaces
 * render the real runnable providers/models (the full pi-ai set, ~35, on every
 * deployment — desktop and hosted alike) instead of the override-only seed.
 *
 * The catalog is static per host session (pi's baked registry — no network,
 * identical across a session), so it is cached with an infinite `staleTime`; a
 * host change is a fresh session. Hydration runs synchronously during render
 * keyed on the query result, mutating `PROVIDERS` in place so every existing
 * `PROVIDERS` importer sees the update at read time.
 *
 * The fetch calls the host client DIRECTLY (`getEngine().getCatalog()`), not the
 * toasting `call()` wrapper: this hook is the SOLE owner of the query and renders
 * its OWN, user-friendly failure toast (below), so routing through `call()` would
 * fire a second, raw "engine error 404" toast on top of it. This mirrors
 * `useCapabilities`, which self-toasts for the same reason. A failure is NEVER
 * swallowed — the user sees a toast (no-silent-failures policy) while the seed
 * keeps the UI working.
 *
 * Returns `{ isReady, updatedAt, catalog, isLoading }`. `updatedAt` changes
 * whenever the cache is re-hydrated, so a `PROVIDERS`-derived memo can re-key on
 * it; `catalog`/`isLoading` let the AI Hub derive its view from THIS query
 * instead of registering a second observer of `["provider-catalog"]` with a
 * divergent queryFn (which made a catalog failure toast twice, last-observer-wins).
