 * This durable stage closes that gap: the first-run onboarding records it
 * (`use-first-run-onboarding.ts`) and its finish clears it, and App routes
 * into onboarding while one is set. An absent or unknown value (every
 * existing, fully-onboarded user) reads as `"none"`.
 *
 * A resumed run's route is derived from what is already done (survey
 * answered, AI connected, team card reached), so it lands on the first screen
 * still owed rather than asking for that work twice.
