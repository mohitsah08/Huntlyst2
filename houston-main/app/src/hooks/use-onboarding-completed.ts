 * terminal path, when the migration wizard persists a "done" outcome, and
 * backfilled for existing active users (agents present) on boot. Absent flag on
 * a genuinely fresh install reads as not-completed, so first-run is unchanged.
 *
 * Hardened like `useOnboardingSegment`: keyed by uid (no stale value across a
 * user switch) with a uid-keyed localStorage mirror, so a failed or unreachable
 * account pref read never DOWNGRADES a completed user back into onboarding.
 * The merge itself is `resolveOnboardingCompleted` (pure, unit-tested).
